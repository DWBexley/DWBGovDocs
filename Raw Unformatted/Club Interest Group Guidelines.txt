DEFINITIONS
• SANCTIONED CLUB: Any group of Association members who are Interested In pursuing a specific hobby, recreational, social or cultural Interest, subject to the policies and procedures outlined within the Del Webb Sanctioned Club Operating Manual or as otherwise approved by the HOA Board. Sanctioned clubs are not granted to groups that require, as a precondition for club membership, subsequent membership In affiliated national, state, or regional organizations. Any affiliation must be optional on the part of the Individual member. Additionally, sanctioned clubs will not be approved for any group that sets a restrictive precondition for membership. Membership must be open to all bona fide members of the Association without discrimination as to race, religion, color, ethnic culture, or national heritage. Segregated activities for male and female members may be established if desired by both genders, and each gender has the same opportunity to pursue common interests; e.g., men's and ladies social clubs, men's and ladies golf clubs. Sanctioned Clubs should be complimentary to the Association's programs. Proper coordination between the Association and prospective clubs is necessary to ensure that the Intent for club has been satisfied, and that Association space is both adequate and available to support the intended club function. Benefits of Sanctioned club include reserved facility space for club activities, Insurance coverage and administrative support through the HOA. As a component of the Club application process, and to protect the Interests of the community at large, groups are required to demonstrate that appropriate cash controls, safety procedures and methods to fairly administer group activities are in place.
INTEREST GROUPS & COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS: Any group of Association members who are Interested In pursuing activities that benefit various religious, community service or political interests but do not satisfy the Intent for a sanctioned club.

Space may be provided on a first-come, first-serve basis, but It will not be allocated to preempt or disrupt an Association sponsored activity. When space Is dedicated for use by an Interest Group or Community Service Organization, a predetermined rental fee is typically charged. To assist the group in their start-up effort, however, fees are Initially waived for a period of 6 months and also discounted over any regular rental rates subsequent to that time. In all cases, the Association reserves the right to disapprove requests for community service and interest group space, or curtail a previous authorization, if the needs of the general membership warrant.
