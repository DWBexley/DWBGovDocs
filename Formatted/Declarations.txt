any reason whatsoever. No amendment shall alter the provisions of this Declaration regarding the

Declaration, then the prior written consent of such entity or agency must also be obtained. All 
amendments affecting the SWMS or any Conservation Areas must comply with Section 25.2

limitation, Declarant may create easements over, under and across Lots conveyed to Owners 
provided that such easements do not materially and adversely impact the use of Homes on such 
Lots as residential dwellings. In the event the Association shall desire to amend this Declaration 
prior to the Turnover, the Association must first obtain Declarant's prior written consent to any 
proposed amendment, which can be withheld in Declarant's sole discretion. Thereafter, an 
amendment identical to that approved by Declarant may be adopted by the Association pursuant 
to the requirements for amendments from and after the Turnover. Declarant shall join in such 
identical amendment so that its consent to the same will be reflected in the Public Records. To the 
extent legally required, each Owner shall be deemed to have granted to Declarant and, thereafter, 
the Association an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest, for the purposes herein 
expressed.

general and specific restrictions on amendments set forth herein, this Declaration may be amended

Declarant shall have the right to amend this Declaration, from time to time, to make such changes, 
modifications and additions therein and thereto as may be requested or required by HUD, FHA, 
VA, FNMA, GNMA, SWFWMD, or any other governmental agency or body as a condition to, or 
in connection with, such agency's or body's regulatory requirements or agreement to make, 
purchase, accept, insure, guaranty or otherwise approve loans secured by mortgages on Lots. No 
approval or joinder of the Association, other Owners, or any other party shall be required or 
necessary to such amendment. After the Turnover, but subject to the general restrictions on 
amendments set forth above, the Board shall have the right to amend this Declaration, from time 
to time, to make such changes, modifications and additions therein and thereto as may be requested

WEBB BEXLEY shall not apply to any Lot that has been conveyed to an Owner unless that right 
is specifically reserved in the instrument of conveyance or the prior written consent of the Owner 
is obtained. Except as provided above, the withdrawal of any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY

successors or assigns of the Association for Assessments to the extent that Assessments are 
required to enable the successors or assigns of the Association to properly maintain, operate and 
preserve the Common Areas. The provisions of this Section only shall apply with regard to the 
maintenance, operation, and preservation of those portions of DEL WEBB BEXLEY that had been

to this Declaration, their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns, for a term 
of twenty-five (25) years from the date this Declaration is recorded in the Public Records, after 
which time the covenants, conditions and restrictions contained in this Declaration shall be 
automatically extended for successive periods of ten (10) years unless prior to the end of such 
twenty-five (25) year period, or each successive ten (10) year period, an instrument signed by 
eighty percent (80%) of the total Voting Interests agreeing to terminate this Declaration has been 
recorded in the Public Records. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, prior to any such 
termination of the Declaration, ownership of the portion of the SWMS owned by the Association, 
if any, and the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the SWMS, to the extent the 
SWMS is not operated and maintained by the CDD, must be transferred to and accepted by an 
entity in accordance with the rules and regulations of SWFWMD and any such transfer and 
acceptance must be approved in writing by SWFWMD. Provided, however, that no such 
agreement to terminate the covenants, conditions and restrictions shall be effective unless made 
and recorded at least ninety (90) days in advance of the effective date of such change. 

7.2 Transfer. The transfer of the fee simple title to a Home or Lot, whether voluntary 
or by operation of law, terminating an Owner's title to that Home or Lot, shall terminate the 
Owner's rights to use and enjoy the Common Areas and shall terminate such Owner's membership 
in the Association. An Owner's rights and privileges under this Declaration are not assignable 
separately from a Lot. The record title owner of a Lot is entitled to the benefits of, and is burdened

Declaration. The transferor of any Lot shall remain jointly and severally liable with the transferee 
for all obligations pursuant to this Declaration that accrue prior to the date of such transfer, 
including without limitation, payment of all Assessments accruing prior to the date of transfer. 

7.3 Membership and Voting Rights.

fully provided in the Articles and Bylaws, each Owner shall be a member of the 
Association. Membership rights are governed by the provisions of this Declaration, the 
Articles and Bylaws. Membership shall be an appurtenance to and may not be separated 
from the ownership of a Lot. Declarant rights with respect to membership in the 
Association are set forth in this Declaration, the Articles and Bylaws. The Association 
shall have the following two (2) classes of voting membership: 

7.3.1.1 Class A Members. Class A members shall be all Owners. Each 
Class A member shall be entitled to one (l) vote for each Lot owned. When more 
than one person holds an interest in any Lot as an "Owner," all such persons shall 
be members. The vote for such Lot shall be exercised as such persons determine, 
but in no event shall more than one (1) vote be cast with respect to any Lot. 

7.3.1.2 Class B Members. Declarant shall be the Class B member and shall 
be entitled to nine (9) votes for each Lot owned; provided, however, as to land

development under the Plat, Declarant shall be entitled to fourteen (14) votes per 
acre or fraction thereof contained within such Parcel owned by Declarant, until such 
time as the Parcel is platted into Lots, whereupon Declarant shall be entitled to nine 
(9) votes per Lot in lieu of the votes per acre. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from 
and after the Turnover Date, the Declarant shall be entitled to one (l) vote for each 
Lot owned. "Turnover" shall mean the transfer of control and operation of the 
Association by the Declarant to Owners. The Turnover of the Association by the 
Declarant shall occur on the Turnover Date at the Turnover meeting. At the 
Turnover meeting, Owners shall elect a majority of the Directors. No more than

Association shall notify in writing all Class A members of the date, location, and 
purpose of the Turnover meeting. The Turnover shall take place within three (3) 
months of the occurrence of the following events, whichever occurs earliest: 

(a) When ninety percent (90%) of the Lots ultimately planned for DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY are conveyed to Owners; or

to give written notice to the Association of its decision to cause the Turnover 
to occur; or 

(c) as otherwise required under the Florida Statutes. 

7.3.1.3 Declarant Election of Director. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
from and after Turnover, for so long as Declarant holds at least five percent (5%) 
of the total number of Lots planned for DEL WEBB BEXLEY out for sale, 
Declarant, at Declarant's sole option, may elect one (1) member of the Board. 
Nothing herein shall require Declarant to elect or place any members on the Board 
after Turnover. 

7.4 In the event that an Owner is other than a natural person, that 
Owner shall, prior to occupancy of the Home, designate one or more persons who are to be the 
occupants of the Home and register such persons with the Association. All provisions of this 
Declaration and other Governing Documents shall apply to both such Owner and the designated 
occupants. 

7.5 Voting Interests. Voting Interests in the Association are governed by this 
Declaration, the Articles and Bylaws. 

7.6 Document Recordation Prohibited. Neither the Association nor any Owner, nor 
group of Owners, may record any documents that, in any way, affect or restrict the rights of 
Declarant or conflict with the provisions of this Declaration or the other Governing Documents. 

7.7 Conflicts. In the event of any conflict among this Declaration, the Articles, the 
Bylaws or any of the other Governing Documents, this Declaration shall control.

the Community Completion Date, Declarant shall have the paramount right to dedicate, transfer, 
and/or convey (by absolute conveyance, easement, or otherwise) portions of DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY for various public purposes or for the provision of telecommunications systems, or to 
make any portions of DEL WEBB BEXLEY part of the Common Areas, or to create and implement 
a special taxing district which may include all or any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY. SALES 
BROCHURES, SITE PLANS, AND MARKETING MATERIALS ARE CURRENT 
CONCEPTUAL REPRESENTATIONS AS TO WHAT IMPROVEMENTS, IF ANY, WILL BE 
INCLUDED WITHIN THE COMMON AREAS. DECLARANT SPECIFICALLY RESERVES 
THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE LAYOUT, COMPOSITION, AND DESIGN OF ANY AND 
ALL COMMON AREAS, INCLUDING RECREATIONAL FACILITIES, OR TO MODIFY,

9. Common Areas. Common Areas shall include, without limitation, (i) Tracts dedicated or
contemplated to be dedicated to the Association as depicted on the Plat, (ii) Tracts conveyed to the 
Association by separate instrument and (iii) all easements in favor of the Association created by 
the Plat, under this Declaration or by separate instrument recorded in the Public Records, and such 
tracts and easements are hereby dedicated and granted to the Association.

Association as set forth in Section 9.4 herein, any portion of the Common Areas owned by 
Declarant shall be operated, maintained, and administered at the sole cost of the Association for 
all purposes and uses reasonably intended, as Declarant in its sole discretion deems appropriate. 
During such period, Declarant shall own, operate, and administer the Common Areas without 
interference from any Owner or any other person or entity whatsoever. Owners shall have no right 
in or to any Common Areas referred to in this Declaration unless and until same are actually 
constructed, completed, and conveyed to the Association. The current conceptual plans and/or 
representations, if any, regarding the composition of the Common Areas are not a guarantee of the 
final composition of the Common Areas. No party should rely upon any statement contained 
herein as a representation or warranty as to the extent of the Common Areas to be constructed by 
Declarant and owned and operated by the Association as part of DEL WEBB BEXLEY. Declarant, 
so long as it controls Association, further specifically retains the right to add to, delete from, or 
modify any of the Common Areas referred to herein at its discretion without notice. It is 
anticipated by the Declarant that many of the facilities to be constructed within DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY for the common use and enjoyment of all Owners including, without limitation the 
SWMS and Conservation Easement Property, will be owned by the CDD or located within an 
easement granted to the CDD and will be operated, maintained and managed by the CDD. 

9.2 Construction of Common Areas Improvements. Declarant anticipates it will 
construct, at its sole cost and expense, certain improvements as part of the Common Areas as 
Declarant determines in its sole discretion, which may include, without limitation, a community 
recreational center with pool, clubhouse, tennis courts, fitness center, meeting rooms, caf , 
restaurant and bar (together the "Community Amenity"), a dog park, passive parks and other 
recreational facilities for the use and benefit of Owners, Lessees and their Immediate Family 
Members and guests (collectively, the "Recreational Facilities"). Declarant shall be the sole 
judge of the composition of any Common Area improvements comprising the Recreational 
Facilities. Prior to the Community Completion Date, Declarant reserves the absolute right to 
construct additional Common Area improvements (including Recreational Facilities) within DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY, from time to time, in its sole discretion, and to remove, add to, modify and 
change the boundaries, facilities and improvements now or then part of the Common Areas 
(including Recreational Facilities). Declarant is not obligated to, nor has it represented that it will 
construct any Common Area improvements or Recreational Facilities. Declarant is the sole judge 
of the Common Area improvements and Recreational Facilities, including the plans, specifications, 
design, location, completion schedule, materials, size, and contents of the facilities, improvements, 
appurtenances, personal property (e.g., furniture), color, textures, finishes or changes or 
modifications to any of them. 

9.3 Use of Common Areas by Declarant. Until the Community Completion Date, 
Declarant shall have the right to use any portion of the Common Areas, without charge, for any 
purpose deemed appropriate by Declarant. 

9.4 Conveyance. 

9.4.1 Generally. The Common Areas may be designated by the Plat or in this 
Declaration, created in the form of easements, or conveyed to the Association by quitclaim 
deed or other instrument of conveyance as determined by the Declarant in its sole and 
absolute discretion. Association shall pay all costs of the conveyance at the Declarant's 
request. The designation of Common Areas, creation by easement, or conveyance shall be 
subject to easements, restrictions, reservations, conditions, limitations, and declarations of 
record, real estate taxes for the year of conveyance, zoning, land use regulations and survey 
matters. Association shall be deemed to have assumed and agreed to pay all continuing 
obligations and service and similar contracts relating to the ownership operation, 
maintenance, and administration of the conveyed portions of Common Areas and other 
obligations relating to the Common Areas imposed herein, and Association shall, and does 
hereby, indemnify and hold Declarant and the Declarant Indemnified Parties harmless on 
account thereof. Association, by its joinder to this Declaration, hereby accepts such 
dedication(s) or conveyance(s) without setoff, condition, or qualification of any nature. 
Association shall accept any and all transfer of permits from Declarant or any other 
permittee, of any permit required by a governmental agency in connection with the 
development of DEL WEBB BEXLEY, including, without limitation, the Permit, as 
modified and/or amended. Association shall cooperate with Declarant or any other 
permittee of such permits, as modified and/or amended, with any applications, 
certifications, documents or consents required to effectuate any such transfer of permits to 
the Association. THE COMMON AREAS, PERSONAL PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
THEREON AND APPURTENANCES THERETO SHALL BE CONVEYED TO THE 
ASSOCIATION IN "AS IS, WHERE IS" CONDITION WITHOUT ANY 
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, IN FACT OR BY 
LAW, AS TO THE CONDITION, FITNESS OR MERCHANTABILITY OF SUCH 
COMMON AREAS PERSONAL PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND APPURTENANCES 
BEING CONVEYED. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such conveyance or 
encumbrance of such Common Areas is subject to an irrevocable ingress and egress 
easement in favor of each Owner granting access to their respective Lots. 

9.4.2 Common Area Reservations. Each deed of the Common Areas shall be 
subject to the following provisions: 

9.4.2.1 a perpetual nonexclusive easement in favor of governmental 
agencies for the maintenance and repair of existing road, speed and directional 
signs, if any; 

9.4.2.2 matters reflected on the Plat; 

9.4.2.3 perpetual non-exclusive easements in favor of Declarant and its 
successors and assigns in, to, upon and over all of the Common Areas for the 
purposes of vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress, installation of 
improvements, utilities, landscaping and/or drainage, without charge, including, 
without limitation, the right to use such roadways for construction vehicles and 
equipment. These easements shall run in favor of Declarant and its employees, 
representatives, agents, licensees, guests, invitees, successors and/or assigns; 

9.4.2.4 the terms and conditions of the CDD Documents, this Declaration 
and all other restrictions, easements, covenants and other matters of record; 

9.4.2.5 in the event that Association believes that Declarant shall have failed 
in any respect to meet Declarant's obligations under this Declaration or has failed 
to comply with any of Declarant's obligations under law, or the Common Areas 
conveyed herein are defective in any respect, the Association shall give written 
notice to Declarant detailing the alleged failure or defect. Once the Association has 
given written notice to Declarant pursuant to this Section, the Association shall be 
obligated to permit Declarant and its agents to perform inspections of the Common 
Areas and to perform all tests and make all repairs/replacements deemed necessary 
by Declarant to respond to such notice at all reasonable times. Association agrees 
that any inspection, test and/or repair/replacement scheduled on a business day 
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. shall be deemed scheduled at a reasonable time. The 
rights reserved in this Section include the right of Declarant to repair or address, in 
Declarant's sole option and expense, any aspect of the Common Areas deemed 
defective by Declarant during its inspections of the Common Areas. Association 
acknowledges and agrees that Association's failure to give the notice and/or 
otherwise comply with the provisions of this Section will irretrievably damage 
Declarant; and 

9.4.2.6 a reservation of right in favor of Declarant (so long as Declarant 
owns any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY) to require that Association re-convey 
all or a portion of the Common Areas by quitclaim deed in favor of Declarant in the 
event that such property is required to be owned by Declarant for any purpose, 
including without limitation, the reconfiguration of any adjacent property by 
replatting or otherwise. To the extent legally required, Association shall be deemed 
to have granted to Declarant an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an 
interest, for the purposes herein expressed. 

9.5 0 Operation After Conveyance. Subject to the Association's right to grant easements 
and other interests as provided herein, and subject to the approval rights of the SWFWMD and the 
County under Section 25.1.7 below with respect to Common Areas containing or affecting the 
SWMS, the Association may not convey, abandon, alienate, encumber, or transfer all or a portion 
of the Common Areas to a third party without (i) if prior to the Turnover, (a) the approval of a 
majority of the Board; and (b) the written consent of Declarant, or (ii) from and after the Turnover, 
approval of (x) a majority of the Board; and (y) fifty-one percent (51%) of the Voting Interests 
present (in person or by proxy) at a duly called meeting of the members. 

9.6 Paved Common Areas. The Common Areas may contain certain paved areas. 
Without limiting any other provision of this Declaration, the Association is responsible for the 
alleyways, driveways, parking areas, pathways, bicycle paths, and sidewalks forming a part of the 
Common Areas, if any. Although pavement appears to be a durable material, it requires 
maintenance. Association shall have the right, but not the obligation, to arrange for a periodic 
inspection of all paved surfaces forming a part of the Common Areas by a licensed paving 
contractor and/or engineer. The cost of such inspection shall be a part of the Operating Expenses 
of the Association. The Association shall determine periodically the parameters of the inspection 
to be performed, if any. Any patching, grading, or other maintenance work should be performed 
by a company licensed to perform the work and shall be an Operating Expense of the Association. 

9.7 Delegation. Once conveyed to the Association, the Common Areas and 
improvements located thereon shall at all times be under the complete supervision, operation, 
control, and management of the Association. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Association may 
delegate all or a portion of its obligations hereunder to a licensed manager or professional 
management company. Association specifically shall have the right to pay for management 
services on any basis approved by the Board (including bonuses or special fee arrangements for 
meeting financial or other goals). Declarant, its affiliates and/or subsidiaries shall have the right 
and option to manage Association at all times prior to Turnover. Owners and Association 
acknowledge that it is fair and reasonable to have Declarant, its affiliates and/or subsidiaries 
manage the Association prior to Turnover. Further, in the event that Common Area is created by 
easement, Association's obligations and rights with respect to such Common Area may be limited 
by the terms of the document creating such easement. 

9.8 Use. 

9.8.1 Nonexclusive Use. Except as provided herein, the Common Areas shall be 
used and enjoyed by the Owners on a non-exclusive basis in common with other persons, 
entities and corporations (who may, but are not required to be, members of the Association) 
entitled to use those portions of the Common Areas subject to the Rules and Regulations 
applicable with respect to same. Prior to the Community Completion Date, Declarant, and 
thereafter, Association has the right, at any and all times, and from time to time, to further 
additionally provide and make the Common Areas available to other individuals, persons, 
firms, or corporations, as it deems appropriate. The granting of such rights shall not 
invalidate this Declaration, reduce or abate any Owner's obligations pursuant to this 
Declaration, or give any Owner the right to avoid any of the covenants, agreements or 
obligations to be performed hereunder. 

9.8.2 Right to Allow Use. Declarant and/or the Association may enter into 
easement agreements or other use or possession agreements whereby the Owners, 
Telecommunications Providers, and/or Association and/or others may obtain the use, 
possession of, or other rights regarding certain property, on an exclusive or non-exclusive 
basis, for certain specified purposes. Association may agree to maintain and pay the taxes, 
insurance, administration, upkeep, repair, and replacement of such property, the expenses 
of which shall be Operating Expenses. Any such agreement by the Association prior to the 
Community Completion Date shall require the prior written consent of Declarant. 
Thereafter, any such agreement shall require the approval of the majority of the Board, 
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

9.8.3 Water Levels of Wet and Dry Retention Areas and Lakes. NEITHER THE 
DECLARANT NOR THE ASSOCIATION MAKE ANY REPRESENTAFION 
CONCERNING THE CURRENT OR FUTURE WATER LEVELS IN ANY OF THE 
WET OR DRY RETENTION AREAS OR ANY LAKES WITHIN, ADJACENT TO OR 
AROUND DEL WEBB BEXLEY , PROVIDED, FURTHER, NEITHER THE 
DECLARANT NOR THE ASSOCIATION BEAR ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO 
ATTEMPT TO ADJUST OR MODIFY THE WATER LEVELS SINCE SUCH LEVELS 
ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL GROUNDWATER AND RAINFALL 
FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE DECLARANT AND 
THE ASSOCIATION. BY ACCEPTANCE OF A DEED TO A HOME OR LOT, EACH 
OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE WATER LEVELS OF ALL SUCH WET OR 
DRY RETENTION AREAS AND LAKES MAY VARY. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE 
BY DECLARANT OR ASSOCIATION THAT WATER LEVELS WILL BE CONSTANT 
OR AESTHETICALLY PLEASING AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME; AT TIMES, WATER 
LEVELS MAY BE NONEXISTENT. DECLARANT AND THE ASSOCIATION SHALL 
NOT BE OBLIGATED TO ERECT FENCES, GATES, OR WALLS AROUND OR 
ADJACENT TO ANY WET OR DRY RETENTION AREAS OR LAKES WITHIN, 
ADJACENT TO OR AROUND DEL WEBB BEXLEY. 

9.8.4 Obstruction of Common Areas. No portion of the Common Areas may be 
obstructed, encumbered, or used by Owners for any purpose other than as permitted by the 
Association. 

9.8.5 Assumption of Risk. Without limiting any other provision herein, (a) each 
Owner, for themselves, their Lessees and for the Immediate Family Members, Guests and 
invitees of such Owner or their Lessees, and (b) each member of the general public 
accessing or using any Common Areas or CDD Facilities (regardless of whether such 
access or use is permitted under this Declaration or otherwise), accepts and assumes all 
risk and responsibility for noise, liability, injury, or damage connected with use or 
occupancy of any portion of such Common Areas or CDD Facilities including, without 
limitation: (i) noise from maintenance equipment; (ii) use of pesticides, herbicides and 
fertilizers; (iii) view restrictions and impairment caused by the construction of any 
structures and/or the maturation of trees and shrubbery; (iv) reduction in privacy caused by 
the removal or pruning of shrubbery or trees within DEL WEBB BEXLEY , and (v) design 
of any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY. Each such person also expressly indemnifies and 
agrees to hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from any and all losses, liabilities, costs, 
damages and expenses, whether direct or consequential, arising from or related to the 
person's use of the Common Areas or CDD Facilities, including for attorneys' fees, 
paraprofessional fees and costs before trial, at trial and upon appeal. Without limiting the 
foregoing, all persons using the Common Areas or CDD Facilities, including, without 
limitation, all wet and dry retention areas, lakes or areas adjacent to any water body, do so 
at their own risk. Nothing herein shall be deemed to grant any such Owner, family member, 
guest, tenant, invitee or member of the general public any rights of access to or use of any 
such wet or dry retention area, lake or water body unless such right is expressly granted by 
this Declaration, the Association or the CDD, and all such access and use shall be subject 
to the Rules and Regulations applicable with respect to same. BY ACCEPTANCE OF A 
DEED, EACH OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE COMMON AREAS AND CDD 
FACILITIES MAY CONTAIN WILDLIFE SUCH AS INSECTS, ALLIGATORS, 
COYOTES, RACCOONS, SNAKES, DUCKS, DEER, SWINE, TURKEYS, BEARS 
AND FOXES. DECLARANT, THE CDD AND THE ASSOCIATION SHALL HAVE NO

OWNER OR LESSEES AND HIS OR HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, 
GUESTS AND INVITEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY. 

9.8.6 Owners' Obligation to Indemnify. Each Owner agrees to indemnify and 
hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against all actions, injury, claims, loss, liability, 
damages, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever ("Losses") incurred by or 
asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after the date hereof, whether 
direct, indirect, or consequential, as a result of or in any way related to the Common Areas, 
including, without limitation, use of the wet and dry retention areas and lakes within DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY by Owners and Lessees, and their Immediate Family Members, guests, 
invitees, or agents. Should any Owner bring suit against Declarant, the Association, the 
CDD or any of the Indemnified Parties for any claim or matter and fail to obtain judgment 
therein against such Indemnified Parties, such Owner shall be liable to such parties for all 
Losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Parties in the defense of such suit, 
including attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees before trial, at trial and upon appeal. 

9.9 Rules and Regulations. 

9.9.1 Generally. Prior to the Turnover, Declarant, and thereafter Association,

Common Areas or CDD Facilities, located within Lots or part of the SWMS dedicated to the CDD

Assessment against such Owner's Lot pursuant to Section 17.2.6 below. By way of example, and 
not of limitation, if the roots of a tree on one Lot subsequently affect pipes or other drainage 
facilities within another Lot, the Owner of the Lot containing such tree (irrespective of whether 
such Owner planted such tree) shall be solely responsible for the removal of the roots which 
adversely affects the adjacent Lot. Likewise, if the roots of a tree located within the Common 
Areas adversely affect an adjacent Lot, the Association shall be responsible for the removal of the 
roots and the costs thereof shall be Operating Expenses. Nothing herein shall preclude the 
Association from maintaining the SWMS as an Operating Expense in the event that the CDD 
should ever fail to maintain same.

including upland buffer areas, or any Perimeter Buffer Easement. No chain link or wooden fencing 
of any kind shall be allowed, and unless otherwise approved by Declarant (or the Association 
following the Turnover Date). Fences, to the extent permitted by this Section 12.14, shall not be 
installed flush to the ground so that drainage will be blocked in any way. All such fences must be 
in compliance with the Architectural Guidelines. Due to the CDD's maintenance requirements 
and responsibilities, the installation of such fences within a drainage easement area is not expected 
to be approved by the ARC. However, in the event a fence is installed within a drainage easement 
area, with or without prior written ARC approval, the Owner is solely responsible for fence repair 
or replacement if the drainage easement area needs to be accessed for repairs or maintenance. As 
a condition to ARC approval of any fences in drainage easement areas, the ARC may require the 
Owner to obtain, at his or her own cost and expense, an agreement in writing executed by the CDD 
approving such fence, which agreement may be recorded in the Public Records by the Association 
in its sole and absolute discretion. All screening and screened enclosures shall have the prior

other structures or paved areas. It is each Owner's responsibility to treat and remove any such 
staining within the Owner's Lot. Declarant or the Association may utilize a computerized loop 
system to irrigate the Common Areas. Any such computerized loop irrigation system that is not 
specifically the maintenance obligation of an Owner, shall be the maintenance obligation of the

such computerized loop irrigation systems to irrigate the Common Areas, including utility costs, 
shall be an Operating Expense. 

12.21 Water Body Slopes. The rear yard of some Lots may border wet retention areas or 
lakes or water bodies forming part of the CDD Facilities or part of the SWMS. The CDD will 
regulate and maintain the water body slopes and banks for such wet retention areas, lakes or water

(1988), as amended, the exemption set out in 42 U.S.C. sS3607(b)(l) and (b)(2)(c) and the 
regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, as may be amended, the "Act") allowing 
discrimination based on familial status by satisfying the Act's Age-Restricted Exemption 
Requirement. Declarant or the Association, acting through the Board, shall have the power to 
amend this Section, without the consent of the Members or any person or entity except Declarant, 
for the purpose of maintaining the age restriction consistent with the Act, the regulations adopted 
pursuant thereto and any related judicial decisions in order to maintain the intent and enforceability 
of this Section. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event the provisions of the Act 01' the Act's 
Age-Restricted Exemption Requirement are amended, restated or replaced with alternate 
provisions modifying or restating the exemption allowing discrimination based upon familial 
status for housing of persons fifty-five (55) years of age or older (or any other age threshold 
designated in same), Declarant or the Association, acting through the Board, shall have the power 
to amend this Section 16 and this Declaration, without the consent of the Members or any other 
person or entity except Declarant, for the purpose of maintaining DEL WEBB BEXLEY'S ability 
to enforce the age restrictions set forth herein or such modified restrictions as are required to 
remain in compliance with the Act, the regulations adopted pursuant thereto and any related 
judicial decisions in order to maintain the intent and enforceability of this Section. 

16.1.1 Each occupied Home shall at all times be Occupied by at least one person 
fifty-five (55) years of age or older; however, in the event of the death of a person who was 
the sole Occupant fifty-five (55) years of age or older of a Home, any Qualified Occupant 
may continue to Occupy the same Home as long as the provisions of the Act are not violated 
by such Occupancy. 

16.1.2 No person under the age of twenty-two (22) shall Occupy a Home. 

16.1.3 Nothing in this Section shall restrict the ownership of or transfer of title to 
any Lot; provided, no Owner under the age of fifty-five (55) may Occupy a I-Iome unless 
the requirements of this Section are met nor shall any Owner permit Occupancy of the 
Home in violation of this Section. Owners shall be responsible for including a statement 
that the Lots within DEL WEBB BEXLEY are intended for the housing of persons fifty- 
five (55) years of age or older and that Occupancy by any person under the age of twenty- 
two (22) is prohibited, as set forth in this Section, in conspicuous type in any Lease 
Agreement or other occupancy agreement or contract of sale relating to such Owner's Lot, 
which agreements or contracts shall be in writing and signed by the Lessee or purchaser 
and for clearly disclosing such intent to any prospective Lessee, purchaser, or other 
potential occupant of the Lot. Every Lease Agreement of a Lot or Home shall provide that 
failure to comply with the requirements and restrictions of this Section shall constitute a 
default under the Lease Agreement. 

16.1.4 Any Owner may request in writing that the Board make an exception to the 
requirements for an Age-Qualified Occupant of this Section with respect to a Home on his 
or her Lot, based on documented hardship. The Board may, but shall not be obligated to, 
grant exceptions in its sole discretion, provided that all of the requirements of the Act and 
the Act's Age-Restricted Exemption Requirement would still be met, and further provided 
that no exception to Section 16.1.2 above shall be granted. 

16.1.5 In the event of any change in Occupancy of any Home, as a result of a 
transfer of title, a lease or sublease, a birth or death, change in marital status, vacancy, 
change in location of permanent Home, or otherwise, the Owner of the Home shall
immediately notify the Board in writing and provide to the Board the names and ages of 
all current occupants of the Home and such other information as the Board may reasonably 
require to verify the age of each occupant required to comply with the Act. In the event that 
an Owner fails to notify the Board and provide all required information within ten (10) 
days after a change in Occupancy occurs, the Association lilay levy monetary fmes against 
the Owner and the Lot for each day after the change in Occupancy occurs until the 
Association receives the required notice and information, regardless of whether the 
Occupants continue to meet the requirements of this Article, in addition to all other 
remedies available to the Association under this Declaration and Florida law. 


16.2 Sales by Declarant. Notwithstanding the restriction set forth in this Section 16, 
Declarant reserves the right to sell Lots and Homes for Occupancy by Persons between forty-five 
(45) and fifty-five (55) years of age; provided, such sales shall not affect the Community's 
compliance with Act's Age-Restricted Exemption Requirement and all applicable State and 
Federal laws under which the Community may be developed and operated as an age-restricted 
community, including requirements that a minimum percentage of Homes be occupied by at least 
one Age-Qualified Occupant as required under Act's Age-Restricted Exemption Requirement and 
the Act or any other such State and Federal laws. 

16.3 Monitoring Compliance; Appointment of Attorney-in-Fact. The Association shall 
be responsible for maintaining records to support and demonstrate compliance with the Act's Age- 
Restricted Exemption Requirement and the Act. The Board shall adopt policies, procedures and 
rules to monitor and maintain compliance with this Section and the Act, including policies 
regarding visitors, updating of age records, the granting of exemptions to compliance and 
enforcement. The Association shall periodically distribute such policies, procedures and rules to 
the Owners and make copies available to Owners, their Lessees and Mortgagees upon reasonable 
request. 

16.4 Enforcement. The Association may enforce this Section 16 in any legal or equitable 
manner available, as the Board deems appropriate, including, without limitation, conducting a 
census of the occupants of Homes, requiring that copies of birth certificates or other proof of age 
for one new Age-Qualified Occupant per Home be provided to the Board on a periodic basis, in 
its sole discretion, taking action to evict the occupants of any Home which does not comply with 
the requirements and restrictions of this Section. Association's records regarding individual 
Members shall be maintained on a confidential basis and not provided except as legally required 
to governing authorities seeking to enforce the Act. Each Owner shall fully and truthfully respond 
to any Association request for information regarding the occupancy of Home on his or her Lot 
which, in the Board's judgment, is reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with this Section. 
Each Owner hereby appoints the Association as its attorney in fact for the purpose of taking legal 
or equitable action to dispossess evict or otherwise remove the occupants of any Home on his or 
her Lot as necessary to enforce compliance with this Section. 

16.5 Owner Compliance and Indemnity. Each Owner shall be responsible for ensuring 
compliance of its Lot with the requirements and restrictions of this Section and the Association 
rules adopted hereunder, by itself and by its Lessees and other occupants of its Lot or Home. Each 
Owner, by acceptance of title to a Lot or Home agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Declarant, 
any affiliate of Declarant and the Association harmless from any and all claims, losses, damages 
and causes of action which may arise from failure of such Owner's Lot to so comply, including, 
without limitation, all assessments, costs, changes, attorneys' fees and other sums assessed against 
or incurred by the Association by the County or School Board (as defined below) under Section 

16.7 below, and same shall be an Individual Assessment against such Owner's Lot. Such defense 
costs shall include, but not be limited to, attorney fees and costs. 

16.6 Household Composition. The Association shall not interfere with the freedom of 
Members and Residents to determine the number of Qualified Occupants within a household, 
except that it may limit the total of Persons entitled to occupy a Home based upon the size of the 
Home (based on such factors as the number of bedrooms), not to exceed the number permitted 
under current zoning ordinances and limit the number of occupants per household who have full 
privileges as members to use of the Common Area. 

16.7 Pasco County Requirements. To be acceptable to the County for waiver of school 
impact fee or reduction of the mobility fee, transportation impact fee ("T IF") or trip generation 
mitigation, and in addition to the other provisions of this Section 16, the following covenants and 
restrictions are hereby imposed on DEL WEBB BEXLEY:

16.7.2 No person under the age of twenty-two (22) shall be allowed to permanently 
occupy any residential unit in DEL WEBB BEXLEY. Occupancy by the said individual(s) 
in any residential unit(s) for more than ninety (90) days shall constitute "permanent" 
occupancy. 

16.7.3 The Association shall be responsible for enforcing the foregoing restrictions 
and shall be jointly and severally liable along with the owner(s) of the violating unit(s) to 
the County and the District School Board of Pasco County ("School Board"), for

waived or reduced if such restrictions have been violated. Such payment(s) shall be 
calculated in accordance with the school impact fee, mobility fee, T IF, or the transportation 
mitigation rates or rules in effect at the time the violation(s) are discovered. 

16.7.4 The foregoing restrictions are for the benefit of the County and the School 
Board who shall have the right to enforce violations of the foregoing restrictions by 
assessment of school impact fees, T IFS, mobility fees, or transportation mitigation by any 
means legally available to the Association or by any other legal remedy, including 
injunctive relief. The County and the School Board shall be entitled to recover any 
attorney's fees expended to enforce violations of the foregoing restrictions or to collect 
school impact fees, T IFS, or transportation mitigation waived or reduced in violation of the 
foregoing restrictions. 

16.7.5 The foregoing restrictions shall survive any expiration of the other 
applicable deed restrictions and shall not be removed or amended without the consent and 
written agreement of both the County and the School Board. 

16.7.6 Individual deeds and lease agreements for real property/units within DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY must contain the following language in its entirety: 

16.7.6.1 The community of DEL WEBB BEXLEY is intended to be

No person under the age of twenty-two (22) shall be allowed to permanently occupy 
any residential unit in DEL WEBB BEXLEY. Occupancy by the said individual(s) 
in any residential unit(s) for more than ninety (90) days shall constitute 
"permanent" occupancy. 

16.7.6.2 The foregoing restrictions are for the benefit of Pasco County 
and the District School Board of Pasco County ("School Board") who shall have 
the right to enforce violations of the foregoing restrictions by assessment of school 
impact fees, mobility fees, transportation impact fees ("TIFs") or transportation 
mitigation by any means legally available to the DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION, INC., or by any other legal remedy, including 
injunctive relief. The County and the School Board shall be entitled to recover any 
attorney's fees expended to enforce violations for the foregoing restrictions or to 
collect school impact fees, mobility fees, T IFS, or transportation mitigation waived 
or reduced in violation of the foregoing restrictions. 

16.7.6.3 The foregoing restrictions shall not be removed or amended 
without the consent and written agreement of both Pasco County and the School 
Board. 

16.7.6.4 This restrictive covenant shall run with the land and be binding 
and enforceable against the lessee or grantee, his heirs, assigns and successors in 
interest. 

16.7.7 In the event of any conflict between the other provisions of Section 16 and 
this Section 16.7, the terms of this Section 16.7 shall control. 

17. Assessments. 

17.1 General. Each Owner, by acceptance of a deed or instrument of conveyance for the 
acquisition of title in any manner (whether or not so expressed in the deed), including any 
purchaser at a judicial sale, shall be deemed to have covenanted and agreed to pay to the 
Association at the time and in the manner required by the Board, assessments or charges as are 
fixed, established and collected from time to time by the Association (collectively, the 
"Assessments"). As Vacant Lots (as defined herein) and Spec Lots (as defined herein) are not 
improved or may not receive certain services, Declarant and any record title owner of a Vacant Lot 
or a Spec Lot shall not be assessed uniformly with Lots containing completed Homes which are 
not Spec Lots. 

17.2 Purpose of Assessments. The Assessments levied by the Association shall be used 
for, among other things, the purpose of operating and maintaining DEL WEBB BEXLEY, and in 
particular, without limitation, for the improvement, operation and maintenance of the Common 
Areas and other land, or landscaping within or adjacent to DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
that are the responsibility of the Association, including, without limitation, the Surface Water 
Management System, to the extent not maintained by the CDD. Assessments shall include the 
following categories of charges as and when levied and deemed payable by the Board: 

17.2.1 Any periodic assessment (on such frequency as determined by the Board) 
or charge for the purpose of operating the Association and accomplishing any and all of its 
purposes, as determined in accordance herewith, including without limitation, payment of 
Operating Expenses and collection of amounts necessary to pay any deficits from prior 
years' operation ("Installment Assessments"); 

17.2.2 Intentionally Deleted. 

17.2.3 Any special assessments for capital improvements, major repairs, 
emergencies, the repair or replacement of the Surface Water Management System, to the 
extent same is the responsibility of the Association, or nonrecurring expenses ("Special 
Assessments"); 

17.2.4 Any specific fees, dues or charges to be paid for any special services, for 
any special or personal use of the Common Areas, or to reimburse the Association for the 
expenses incurred in connection with such service or use ("Use Fees"); 

17.2.5 Assessments of any kind for the creation of reasonable reserves for any of 
the aforesaid purposes. The Board may, but shall have no obligation to, include a "Reserve 
for Replacement" in the Installment Assessments in order to establish and maintain an 
adequate reserve fund for the periodic maintenance, repair, and replacement of 
improvements comprising a portion of the Common Areas (the "Reserves"), including 
without limitation, Reserves for maintenance, repair and replacement of Recreational 
Facilities. Reserves shall be payable in such manner and at such times as determined by 
the Association, and may be payable in installments extending beyond the fiscal year in 
which the Reserves are established; and 

17.2.6 Any specific assessment for costs incurred by the Association which 
amounts are by their nature applicable only to one or more Lots, but less than all Lots 
("Individual Assessments"). By way of example and not limitation, the cost of 
Landscaping and Irrigation Maintenance for each Lot shall be an Individual Assessment 
against each Lot that varies based upon the size category of such Lot as provided in Section 
10.2 above. In addition, in the event an Owner fails to maintain their Lot or the exterior of 
their Home in a manner required by the Governing Documents, the Association shall have 
the right, through its agents and employees, to enter upon the Lot and to repair, restore, and 
maintain the Lot and/or Home as required by the Governing Documents. The costs of any 
such repair, restoration and/or maintenance, plus the reasonable administrative expenses of 
the Association and any costs incurred in bringing a Lot and/or Home into compliance with 
the Governing Documents shall be an Individual Assessment. The lien for an Individual 
Assessment may be foreclosed in the same manner as any other Assessment. 

17.3 Designation. The designation of Assessment type and amount shall be made by the 
Association. Prior to the Community Completion Date, any such designation must be approved 
by Declarant. Such designation may be made on the budget prepared by the Association. The 
designation shall be binding upon all Owners. 

17.4 Allocation of Operating Expenses

17.4.1 Commencing on the first day of the period covered by the annual budget, 
and until the adoption of the next annual budget, the Assessments for Operating Expenses 
and Reserves (if any) shall be allocated so that each Owner shall pay Operating Expenses, 
Special Assessments and Reserves based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is one 
(l) and the denominator of which is the total number of Lots in DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
conveyed to Owners or any greater number determined by Declarant from time to time. 
Declarant, in its sole and absolute discretion may change such denominator from time to 
time; provided, however, under no circumstances will the denominator be less than the 
number of Lots owned by Owners. In addition, any Lot that does not have a Home 
constructed thereon as evidenced by a Certificate of Occupancy (a "Vacant Lot") and any 
Lot that has a Home constructed thereon but is owned by the Declarant or Founder (a "Spec 
Lot") also shall be assessed at ten percent (10%) of the Installment Assessment assessed 
to Lots with Homes constructed thereon and owned by Owners. The Vacant Lot 
Assessment and the Spec Lot Assessment shall be additional income to the Association and 
Vacant Lots and Spec Lots shall not be included in the denominator used to determine each 
Owner's pro rata share of the Operating Expenses and Reserves (if any), unless otherwise 
determined by the Declarant in its sole and absolute discretion. In no event, however, shall 
Declarant pay Special Assessments. 

17.4.2 In the event the Operating Expenses as estimated in the budget for a 
particular fiscal year are, after the actual Operating Expenses for that period is known, less 
than the actual costs, then the difference shall, at the election of the Association: (i) be 
added to the calculation of Installment Assessments, as applicable, for the next ensuing 
fiscal year; or (ii) be immediately collected from the Owners as a Special Assessment. The 
Association shall have the unequivocal right to specially assess Owners retroactively on 
January 1st of any year for any shortfall in Installment Assessments, which Special 
Assessment shall relate back to the date that the Installment Assessments could have been 
made. After the Turnover Date, no vote of the Owners shall be required for such Special 
Assessment (or for any other Assessment) except to the extent specifically provided herein. 
Prior to the Turnover Date, a Special Assessment may be levied by the Association with 
the approval of (i) a majority of the Board; and (ii) fifty-one percent (5 1 of the Voting 
Interests present (in person or by proxy) at a duly called meeting of the members. 

17.4.3 Each Owner agrees that so long as it does not pay more than the required 
amount it shall have no grounds upon which to object to either the method of payment or 
non-payment by other Owners or the Declarant of any sums due. 

17.5 General Assessments Allocation. Installment Assessments shall be uniform for all 
Lots improved with a Home, except as provided in this Declaration. Special Assessments and 
Reserves shall be allocated equally to each Owner. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in the Governing Documents, but subject to the rights of Declarant pursuant to Section 

17.8 of this Declaration, Vacant Lots and Spec Lots shall be assessed at ten percent (10%) of the 
Installment Assessments assessed to Lots with Homes constructed thereon and owned by Owners. 
This lesser Assessment amount reflects that such Vacant Lots and Spec Lots will not benefit from 
maintenance and other services provided by the Association. At such time as a Home is conveyed 
by the Declarant or Founder to an Owner, then the Vacant Lot or Spec Lot, as applicable, shall be 
deemed a fully assessed Lot and shall be responsible for one-hundred percent (100%) of 
Installment Assessments and Special Assessments, except as otherwise provided herein. 

17.6 Use Fees and Individual Assessment. Except as hereinafter specified to the 
contrary, Use Fees and Individual Assessments shall be made against the Owners benefiting from, 
or subject to, the special service or cost as specified by the Association. 

17.7 Commencement of First Assessment. Assessments shall commence as to each 
Owner on the day of the conveyance of title of a Home to such Owner. The record title owner of 
a Lot is jointly and severally liable with the previous record title owner of the Lot for all unpaid 
Assessments that came due up to the time of transfel' of title. A record title owner of a Lot, 
regardless of how title to the Lot has been acquired, including by purchase at a foreclosure sale or 
by deed in lieu of foreclosure, is liable for all Assessments that come due while such person or 
entity was the record title owner of the Lot. An Owner's liability for Assessments may not be 
avoided by waiver or suspension of the use or enjoyment of any Common Areas or by 
abandonment of the Lot upon which the Assessments are made. 

17.8 Shortfalls and Surpluses. Each Owner acknowledges that because Installment 
Assessments, Special Assessments, and Reserves are allocated based on the formula provided 
herein, or upon the number of Lots conveyed to Owners on or prior to September 30th of the prior 
fiscal year, it is possible that the Association may collect more or less than the amount budgeted 
for Operating Expenses. Prior to the Turnover, Declarant shall have the option to (i) pay any 
Operating Expenses incurred by the Association that exceed the Assessments receivable from 
Owners and other income of the Association (the "Deficit"), or (ii) pay Installment Assessments 
on Homes or Lots owned by Declarant at the applicable rate of Installment Assessments 
established for Lots and Homes, including Vacant Lots and Spec Lots, owned by Class A members. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Declaration to the contrary, Declarant shall never be 
required to (i) pay Assessments if Declarant has elected to fund the Deficit instead of paying 
Assessments on Homes or Lots owned by Declarant, (ii) pay Special Assessments or Reserves, or 
(iii) fund deficits due to delinquent Owners. Any surplus Assessments collected by the Association 
may be allocated towards the next year's Operating Expenses or, in the Association's sole and 
absolute discretion, to the creation of Reserves, whether or not budgeted. Under no circumstances 
shall the Association be required to pay surplus Assessments to Owners. The Declarant may at 
any time give thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Association terminating its responsibility 
for the Deficit, and waiving its right to exclusion from Assessments. Upon giving such notice, or 
upon Turnover, whichever is sooner, each Lot owned by Declarant shall thereafter be assessed at 
the applicable rate of Installment Assessments established for Lots and Homes, including Vacant 
Lots and Spec Lots, owned by Class A members. Declarant shall not be responsible for any 
Reserves or Special Assessments, even after the Turnover. Declarant shall be assessed only for 
Lots which are subject to the operation of this Declaration. Upon transfer of title of a Lot owned 
by Declarant, the Lot shall be assessed in the amount established for Lots owned by Owners other 
than the Declarant, prorated as of and commencing with, the month following the date of transfer 
of title.
 
THE DECLARANT DOES NOT PROVIDE A GUARANTEE OF THE LEVEL OF 
ASSESSMENTS. AS SUCH, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM GUARANTEED LEVEL OF 
ASSESSMENTS DUE FROM OWNERS. IN THE EVENT THE DECLARANT ELECTS TO 
DEFICIT FUND IN LIEU OF PAYING ASSESSMENTS ON THE SAME BASIS AS OTHER 
OWNERS, THE DECLARANT SHALL SPECIFICALLY ELECT TO FUND THE DEFICIT AS 
PROVIDED IN SECTION FLORIDA STATUTES. AS SUCH, THE 
PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 720.308(2) THROUGH 720.308(6), FLORIDA STATUTES, ARE 
NOT APPLICABLE TO THE DECLARANT OR THE CALCULATION OF THE DEFICIT OR 
OTHER AMOUNTS DUE FROM THE DECLARANT. 

17.9 Budgets. The initial budget prepared by Declarant is adopted as the budget for the 
period of operation until adoption of the first annual Association budget. Thereafter, annual 
budgets shall be prepared and adopted by the Association. Assessments shall be payable by each 
Owner as provided in this Declaration. THE INITIAL BUDGET OF THE ASSOCIATION IS 
PROJECTED (NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL OPERATING FIGURES). THEREFORE, IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT ACTUAL ASSESSMENTS MAY BE LESS OR GREATER THAN 
PROJECTED. 

17.10 Establishment of Assessments. Assessments shall be established in accordance 
with the following procedures: 

17.10.1 Installment Assessments shall be established by the adoption of a 
twelve (12) month operating budget by the Board. The budget shall be in the form required 
by Section 720.303(6), Florida Statutes. The Board may from time to time determine when 
the Installment Assessments will be collected by the Association (i.e. monthly, quarterly, 
or annually). Unless otherwise established by the Board, Installment Assessments for 
Operating Expenses shall be collected on a monthly basis. 
 
17.10.2 Special Assessments and Individual Assessments may be
established by the Association, from time to time, and shall be payable at such time or 
time(s) as determined by the Board. Until the Community Completion Date, no Special 
Assessment shall be imposed without the consent of Declarant. 

17.10.3 Association may establish, from time to time, by resolution, rule or 
regulation, or by delegation to an officer or agent, including, a professional management 
company, Use Fees. The sums established shall be payable by the Owner utilizing the 
service or facility as determined by the Association. 
 
17.11 Initial Contribution. The first purchaser of a Lot from the Declarant shall pay to
the Association an initial contribution in the amount EIGHT HUNDRED AND NO/IOO 
DOLLARS ($800.00) (the "Initial Contribution") at the time of closing of the conveyance. The 
funds derived from the Initial Contributions are deemed income to the Association and shall be 
used at the discretion of Board for any purpose, including without limitation, future and existing 
capital improvements, Operating Expenses, support costs and start-up costs. 

17.12 Resale Contribution. After the Home has been conveyed by Declarant, there shall 
be collected from the purchaser upon every subsequent conveyance of an ownership interest in a 
Home by an Owner a resale contribution in the amount of EIGHT HUNDRED AND NO/IOO 
DOLLARS ($800.00) (the "Resale Contribution"). The Board, in its discretion, may increase 
the amount of the Resale Contribution from time to time commencing on the date that is five (5) 
years after the date of recordation of this Declaration, provided, however, that the amount of such 
Resale Contribution may not increase at an aggregate rate in excess of two percent (2%) per year 
for the period commencing on the date of recordation of this Declaration through the effective date 
of such increase unless such additional increase is approved pursuant to an amendment to this 
Declaration pursuant to Section 4.4 hereof. The Resale Contribution shall not be applicable to 
conveyances from or to Declarant or Founder. The funds derived from the Resale Contributions 
are income to the Association and shall be used at the discretion of Board for any purpose, 
including without limitation, future and existing capital improvements, Operating Expenses, 
support costs and start-up costs. 

17.13 Assessment Estoppel Certificates. No Owner shall sell or convey its interest in a 
Lot or Home unless all sums due to the Association have been paid in full and an estoppel 
certificate shall have been received by such Owner. Association shall prepare and maintain a 
ledger noting Assessments due from each Owner. The ledger shall be kept in the office of the 
Association, or its designees, and shall be open to inspection by any Owner. Within ten (10) 
business days of a written request therefor, there shall be furnished to an Owner an estoppel 
certificate in writing setting forth whether the Assessments have been paid and/or the amount that 
is due as of any date. As to parties other than Owners who, without knowledge of error, rely on 
the certificate, the certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the amount of any Assessment therein 
stated. The Owner requesting the estoppel certificate shall be required to pay Association or the 
Manager (as defined below) engaged by the Association a reasonable sum to cover the costs of 
examining records and preparing such estoppel certificate. 

17.14 Payment of Home Real Estate Taxes. Each Owner shall pay all taxes and 
obligations relating to its Lot which, if not paid, could become a lien against the Lot that is superior 
to the lien for Assessments created by this Declaration. 

17.15 Creation of the Lien and Personal Obligation. Each Owner, by acceptance of a deed 
or instrument of conveyance for the acquisition of title to a Lot, shall be deemed to have 
covenanted and agreed that the Assessments, and/or other charges and fees set forth herein, 
together with interest, late fees, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees at 
all levels of proceedings including appeals, collections and bankruptcy, shall be a charge and 
continuing lien in favor of the Association encumbering the Lot owned by the Owner against whom 
each such Assessment is made. The lien is effective from and after recording a Claim of Lien in 
the Public Records stating the legal description of the Lot, name of the Owner, and the amounts 
due as of that date, but shall relate back to the date that this Declaration is recorded. The Claim of 
Lien shall also cover any additional amounts which accrue thereafter until satisfied. Each 
Assessment, together with interest, late fees, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and 
paraprofessional fees at all levels including appeals, collections and bankruptcy, and other costs 
and expenses provided for herein, shall be the personal obligation of the person or entity that was 
the record title owner of the Lot at the time when the Assessment became due, as well as the such 
record title owner's heirs, devisees, personal representatives, successors or assigns. 

17.16 Subordination of the Lien to Mortgages. The lien for Assessments shall be 
subordinate to bona fide first mortgage held by a Lender on any Lot, if the mortgage is recorded 
in the Public Records prior to the Claim of Lien. The lien for Assessments shall not be affected 
by any sale or transfer of a Lot, except in the event of a sale or transfer of a Lot pursuant to a 
foreclosure (or by deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) of a bona fide first mortgage held by a 
Lender, in which event, the acquirer of title, its successors and assigns, shall be liable for 
Assessments which became due prior to such sale or transfer to the extent provided in Section 
720.3085, Florida Statutes. However, any such unpaid Assessments for which such acquirer of 
title is not liable may be reallocated and assessed to all Owners (including such acquirer of title) 
as a part of Operating Expenses. Any sale or transfer pursuant to a foreclosure (or by deed in lieu 
of foreclosure or otherwise pursuant to a foreclosure) shall not relieve the record title owner from 
liability for, nor the Lot from, the lien of any Assessments made thereafter. Nothing herein 
contained shall be construed as releasing the party liable for any delinquent Assessments from the 
payment thereof, or the enforcement of collection by means other than foreclosure. A Lender shall 
give written notice to the Association if the mortgage held by such Lender is in default. 
Association shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure such default within the time periods 
provided in the mortgage held by such Lender. In the event Association makes such payment on 
behalf of a record title owner, the Association shall, in addition to all other rights reserved herein, 
be subrogated to all of the rights of the Lender with respect to such payment. All amounts 
advanced on behalf of a record title owner pursuant to this Section shall be added to Assessments 
payable by such record title owner with appropriate interest. 

17.17 Acceleration. In the event of a default in the payment of any Assessment, the 
Association may accelerate the Assessments then due for up to the next ensuing twelve (12) month 
period. 

17.18 Non-Payment of Assessments. If any Assessment is not paid within ten (10) days 
(or such other period of time established by the Board) after the due date, a late fee of Twenty-Five 
and no/ 100 Dollars ($25.00) per month or five percent of the delinquent installments whichever is 
greater (or such greater amount established by the Board and permitted by applicable law), together 
with interest in an amount equal to the maximum rate allowable by law (or such lesser rate 
established by the Board), per annum, beginning from the due date until paid in full, may be levied. 
The late fee shall compensate the Association for administrative costs, loss of use of money, and 
accounting expenses. Su12ject to providing any prior notice as may be required by law, if any, the 
Association may, at any time thereafter, bring an action at law against the record title owner 
personally obligated to pay the same, and/or foreclose the lien against the Lot, or both. The 
Association shall not be required to bring such an action if it believes that the best interests of the 
Association would not be served by doing so. There shall be added to the Assessment all costs 
expended in preserving the priority of the lien and all costs and expenses of collection, including 
attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees, at all levels of proceedings, including appeals, collection 
and bankruptcy. No Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for Assessments provided for 
herein by non-use of, or the waiver of the right to use, the Common Areas or by abandonment of 
a Lot or Home. All payments on accounts shall be first applied to fines levied in accordance with 
the terms of this Declaration, interest accrued by the Association, then to any administrative late 
fee, then to costs and attorneys' fees, and then to the delinquent Assessment payment first due. 
The allocation of payment described in the previous sentence shall apply notwithstanding any 
restrictive endorsement, designation, or instruction placed on or accompanying a payment. 

17.19 Exemption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Declarant, at 
Declarant's sole option, shall either (i) pay Assessments on Lots and Homes owned by Declarant, 
including the applicable rate for Vacant Lots or Spec Lots, or (ii) fund the Deficit, if any, as set 
forth in Section 17.8 herein. In addition, the Board shall have the right to exempt any portion of 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY subject to this Declaration from the Assessments, provided that such part 
of DEL WEBB BEXLEY exempted is used (and as long as it is used) for any of the following 
purposes: 
 
17.19.1 Any easement or other interest therein dedicated and accepted by
the local public authority and devoted to public use; and 
 
17.19.2 Any of DEL WEBB BEXLEY exempted from ad valorem taxation
by the laws of the State of Florida or exempted from Assessments by other provisions of 
this Declaration.
 
In addition any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY that is owned by Founder shall be exempt 
from Assessments. 

17.20 Collection by Declarant. If for any reason the Association shall fail or be unable to 
levy or collect Assessments, then in that event, Declarant shall at all times have the right, but not 
the obligation: (i) to advance such sums as a loan to the Association to bear interest and to be 
repaid as hereinafter set forth; and/or (ii) to levy and collect such Assessments by using the 
remedies available as set forth above, including, but not limited to, recovery of attorneys' fees and 
paraprofessional fees at all levels including appeals, collections and bankruptcy. Such remedies 
shall be deemed assigned to Declarant for such purposes. If Declarant advances sums, it shall be 
entitled to immediate reimbursement, on demand, from Association for such amounts so paid, plus 
interest thereon at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus two percent (2%), plus any costs of 
collection including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees at all 
levels including appeals, collections and bankruptcy. 

17.21 Rights to Pay Assessments and Receive Reimbursement. Association, Declarant 
and any Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, jointly and severally, and at their sole 
option, to pay any Assessments or other charges which are in default and which may or have 
become a lien or charge against any Lot or Home. If so paid, the party paying the same shall be 
subrogated to the enforcement rights of the Association with regard to the amounts due. 

17.22 Mortgagee Right. Each Lender may request in writing that Association notify such 
Lender of any default of the Owner of the Home subject to the Lender's mortgage which default 
is not cured within thirty (30) days after Association learns of such default. A failure by the 
Association to furnish notice to any Lender shall not result in liability of the Association because 
such notice is given as a courtesy to a Lender and the furnishing of such notice is not an obligation 
of the Association to Lender. 

17.23 Collection from Lessees. If a Home is occupied by a Lessee and the Owner is 
delinquent in the payment of Assessments, the Association may demand from the Lessee payment 
to the Association of all monetary obligations, including without limitation, Assessments due from 
the Owner to the Association. All such payments made by a Lessee to the Association shall be 
credited against rent and other sums due from such Lessee to such Owner. So long as the Owner 
remains delinquent, future rent payments due to the Owner must be paid to the Association and 
shall be credited to the monetary obligations of the Owner to the Association; provided, however, 
if within fourteen (14) days from the written demand of the Association, the Lessee provides the 
Association with written evidence of making prepaid rent payments, the Lessee shall receive a 
credit f r the prepaid rent for the applicable period of such prepaid rent. 
 
18. Information to Lenders and Owners.

18.1 There shall be available for inspections upon request, during normal 
business hours or under other reasonable circumstances, to Owners and Lenders current copies of 
the Governing Documents. 

18.2 Copying. Any Owner and/or Lender shall be entitled, upon written request, and at 
its cost, to a copy of the documents referred to above. 

18.3 Notice. Upon written request by a Lender (identifying the name and address of the 
Lender and the name and address of the applicable Owner), the Lender will be entitled to timely 
written notice of: 

18.3.1 Any condemnation loss or casualty loss which affects a material portion of 
a Home to the extent Association is notified of the same; 

18.3.2 Any delinquency in the payment of Assessments owed by an Owner of a 
Home subject to a first mortgage held by the Lender, which remains uncured for a period 
of sixty (60) days; 

18.3.3 Any lapse, cancellation, or material modification of any insurance policy or 
fidelity bond maintained hereunder; and 

18.3.4 Any proposed action that specifically requires the consent of a Lender. 

19. Architectural Control. 

19.1 Architectural Review Committee. The ARC shall be a permanent committee of the 
Association and shall administer and perform the architectural and landscape review and control 
functions relating to DEL WEBB BEXLEY. The ARC shall consist of a minimum of three (3) 
members who shall initially be named by Declarant and who shall hold office at the pleasure of 
Declarant, provided, however, that pursuant to Section 28.5 below, Founder has the option to 
appoint one (l ) member of the ARC until such time as Declarant has purchased all of the Additional

and to appoint, remove, and replace all members of the ARC other than the member, if any, 
appointed by Founder. Declarant shall determine which members of the ARC shall serve as its 
chairman and co-chairman. In the event of the failure, refusal, or inability to act of any of the 
members appointed by Declarant, Declarant shall have the right to replace any member within 
thirty (30) days of such occurrence. If Declarant fails to replace that member, the remaining 
members of the ARC shall fill the vacancy by appointment. From and after the Community 
Completion Date, the Board shall have the same rights as Declarant with respect to the ARC. 

19.2 Membership. There is no requirement that any member of the ARC be a member 
of the Association. 

19.3 General Plan. It is the intent of this Declaration to create a general plan and scheme 
of development of DEL WEBB BEXLEY. Accordingly, the ARC shall have the right to approve 
or disapprove all architectural, landscaping, and improvements within DEL WEBB BEXLEY by 
Owners. The ARC shall have the right to evaluate all plans and specifications as to consistency 
with the Architectural Guidelines and Approved Plans, harmony of exterior design, landscaping, 
location of any proposed improvements, relationship to surrounding structures, topography and 
conformity with such other reasonable requirements as shall be adopted by ARC. The ARC may 
impose standards for construction and development which may be greater or more stringent than 
standards prescribed in applicable building, zoning, or other local governmental codes. Prior to 
the Community Completion Date, any additional standards or modification of existing standards 
shall require the consent of Declarant, which may be granted or denied in its sole discretion. 

19.4 Master Plan. Declarant has established an overall Master Plan. However, 
notwithstanding the above, or any other document, brochures or plans, Declarant reserves the right 
to modify the Master Plan or any site plan at any time as it deems desirable in its sole discretion 
and in accordance with applicable laws and ordinances. WITHOUT LIMITING THE 
FOREGOING, DECLARANT MAY PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC OR TO OWNERS 
RENDERINGS, PLANS, MODELS, GRAPHICS, TOPOGRAPHICAL TABLES, SALES 
BROCHURES, OR OTHER PAPERS RESPECTING DEL WEBB BEXLEY. SUCH 
RENDERINGS, PLANS, MODELS, GRAPHICS, TOPOGRAPHICAL TABLES, SALES 
BROCHURES, OR OTHER PAPERS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE OF HOW DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY WILL APPEAR UPON COMPLETION AND DECLARANT RESERVES THE 
RIGHT TO CHANGE ANY AND ALL OF TI-IE FOREGOING AT ANY TIME AS DECLARANT 
DEEMS NECESSARY IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION. 

19.5 Architectural Guidelines. Each Owner and its contractors and employees shall 
observe, and comply with, and all construction in DEL WEBB BEXLEY shall be consistent with 
(i) the Architectural Guidelines which now or may hereafter be promulgated by the Declarant or 
the ARC and approved by Founder pursuant to Section 28.6 below and (ii) Approved Plans as 
approved by Founder pursuant to Section 28.8 below. The Architectural Guidelines and Approved 
Plans shall be effective from the date of adoption; shall be specifically enforceable by injunction 
or otherwise: and shall have the effect of covenants as if set forth herein verbatim. The 
Architectural Guidelines and Approved Plans shall not require any Owner to alter the 
improvements previously constructed. Until the Community Completion Date, Declarant, subject 
to approval of same by Founder pursuant to Sections 28.6 and 28.8 below, shall have the right to 
approve, adopt or amend the Architectural Guidelines and Approved Plans in its sole discretion. 

19.6 Quorum. A majority of the ARC shall constitute a quorum to transact business at 
any meeting. The action of a majority present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall

exterior of a Home shall be repainted, no landscaping, sign, or impl'ovements erected, removed, 
planted, or installed upon on a Lot, nor shall any material addition to or any change, replacement,

materials, floor plans, color scheme, and the location of same shall have been submitted to and 
approved in writing by the ARC. 

19.8 Procedure. In order to obtain the approval of the ARC, each Owner shall observe 
the following: 

19.8.1 Each applicant shall submit an application to the ARC with respect to any 
proposed improvement or material change in an improvement, together with the required 
application(s) and other fee(s) as established by the ARC. The applications shall include 
such information as may be required by the application form adopted by the ARC. The 
ARC may also require submission of samples of building materials and colors proposed to 
be used. At the time of such submissions, the applicant shall, if requested, submit to the 
ARC, such site plans, plans and specifications for the proposed improvement, prepared and 
stamped by a registered Florida architect or residential designer, and landscaping and 
irrigation plans, prepared by a registered landscape architect or designer showing all

finish elevation, pool plans and specifications and the times scheduled for completion, all 
as reasonably specified by the ARC. 

19.8.2 In the event the information submitted to the ARC is, in the ARC's opinion, 
incomplete or insufficient in any manner, the ARC may request and require the submission 
of additional or supplemental information. The applicant shall, within fifteen (15) days 
thereafter, comply with the request. 

19.8.3 No later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of all information required 
by the ARC for final review, the ARC shall approve or deny the application in writing. The 
ARC shall have the right to refuse to approve any plans and specifications which are not 
suitable or desirable, in the ARC's sole discretion, for aesthetic or any other reasons or to 
impose qualifications and conditions thereon. In approving or disapproving such plans and 
specifications, the ARC shall consider the suitability of the proposed improvements, the 
materials of which the improvements are to be built, the site upon which the improvements 
are proposed to be erected, the harmony thereof with the surrounding area and the effect 
thereof on adjacent or neighboring property. In the event the ARC fails to respond within 
said forty-five (45) day period, the plans and specifications shall be deemed disapproved 
by the ARC. 

19.8.4 Construction of all improvements shall be completed within the time period 
set forth in the application and approved by the ARC. 

19.8.5 In the event that the ARC disapproves any plans and specifications, the 
applicant may request a rehearing by the ARC for additional review of the disapproved 
plans and specifications. The meeting shall take place no later than forty-five (45) days 
after written request for such meeting is received by the ARC, unless applicant waives this 
time requirement in writing. The ARC shall make a fmal written decision no later than 
forty-five (45) days after such meeting. In the event the ARC fails to provide such written 
decision within said forty-five (45) days, the plans and specifications shall be deemed 
disapproved. 

19.8.6 Upon final disapproval (even if the members of the Board and the ARC are 
the same), the applicant may appeal the decision of the ARC to the Board within thirty (30) 
days of the ARC's written review and disapproval. Review by the Board shall take place 
no later than thirty (30) days subsequent to the receipt by the Board of the applicant's 
request therefor. If the Board fails to hold such a meeting within thirty (30) days after 
receipt of request for such meeting, then the plans and specifications shall be deemed 
disapproved. The Board shall make a final decision no later than sixty (60) days after such 
meeting. In the event the Board fails to provide such written decision within said sixty 
(60) days after such meeting, such plans and specifications shall be deemed disapproved. 
The decision of the ARC, or, if appealed, the Board, shall be final and binding upon the 
applicant, its heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. 

19.9 Alterations. Any and all alterations, deletions, additions and changes of any type 
or nature whatsoever to then existing improvements or the plans or specifications previously 
approved by the ARC shall be subject to the approval of the ARC in the same manner as required 
for approval of original plans and specifications. 

19.10 Variances. Association or ARC shall have the power to grant variances from any 
requirements set forth in this Declaration or from the Architectural Guidelines, on a case by case 
basis, provided that the variance sought is reasonable and results from a hardship upon the 
applicant. The granting of a variance shall not nullify or otherwise affect the right to require strict 
compliance with the requirements set forth herein or in the Architectural Guidelines on any other 
occasion. 

19.11 Permits. Each Owner is solely responsible to obtain all required building and other 
permits from all governmental authorities having jurisdiction.

construction site in DEL WEBB BEXLEY shall be maintained in a neat and orderly 
condition throughout construction. Construction activities shall be performed on a diligent, 
workmanlike and continuous basis. Roadways, easements, swales, Common Areas, and 
other such areas in DEL WEBB BEXLEY shall be kept clear of construction vehicles,

all applicable federal, state and local statutes, regulations and ordinances, and shall not be 
deposited in any manner on, in or within the construction or adjacent property. All 
construction activities shall comply with the Architectural Guidelines. If an Owner (or any 
of its contractors and employees) shall fail to comply in any regard with the requirements 
of this Section, the ARC may require that such Owner post security with the Association 
in such form and such amount deemed appropriate by the ARC in its sole discretion. 
 

19.12.2 There shall be provided to the ARC, if requested, a list (name,
address, telephone number and identity of contact person), of all contractors, 
subcontractors, materialmen and suppliers (collectively, "Contractors") and changes to 
the list as they occur relating to construction. The ARC shall have the right to require that 
each Contractor's employees check in at the designated construction entrances and to 
refuse entrance to persons and parties whose names are not registered with the ARC. 

19.12.3 Each Owner is responsible for ensuring compliance with all terms 
and conditions of these provisions and of the Architectural Guidelines by all of its 
employees and Contractors. In the event of any violation of any such terms or conditions 
by any employee or Contractor, or, in the opinion of the ARC, the continued refusal of any 
employee or Contractor to comply with such terms and conditions, after five (5) days' 
notice and right to cure, the ARC shall have, in addition to the other rights hereunder, the 
right to prohibit the violating employee or Contractor from performing any further services 
in DEL WEBB BEXLEY. 

19.12.4 The ARC may, from time to time, adopt standards governing the 
performance or conduct of Owners, Contractors and their respective employees within 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY Each Owner and Contractor shall comply with such standards and 
cause its respective employees to also comply with same. The ARC may also promulgate 
requirements to be inserted in all contracts relating to construction within DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY and each Owner shall include the same therein. 

19.13 Inspection. There is specifically reserved to the Association and ARC and to any 
agent or member of either of them, the right of entry and inspection upon any portion of DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY at any time within reasonable daytime hours, for the purpose of determining 
whether there exists any violation of the terms of any approval or the terms of this Declaration or 
the Architectural Guidelines. 

19.14 Violation. Without limiting any other provision herein, if any improvement shall 
be constructed or altered without prior written approval, or in a manner which fails to conform 
with the approval granted, the Owner, as applicable, shall, upon demand of the Association or the 
ARC, cause such improvement to be removed, or restored until approval is obtained or in order to 
comply with the plans and specifications originally approved. The applicable Owner shall be liable 
for the payment of all costs of removal or restoration, including all costs and attorneys' fees and 
paraprofessional fees at all levels including appeals, collections and bankruptcy, incurred by the 
Association or ARC. The costs shall be deemed an Individual Assessrnent and enforceable 
pursuant to the provisions of this Declaration. The ARC and/or Association are specifically 
empowered to enforce the architectural and landscaping provisions of this Declaration and the 
Architectural Guidelines, by any legal or equitable remedy. 
 
19.15 Court Costs. In the event that it becomes necessary to resort to litigation to
determine the propriety of any constructed improvement or to cause the removal of any 
unapproved improvement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover court costs, expenses 
and attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees at all levels, including appeals, collections and 
bankruptcy, in connection therewith. 

19.16 Certificate of Non-Compliance. In the event that any Owner fails to comply with 
the provisions contained herein, the Architectural Guidelines, or other rules and regulations 
promulgated by the ARC, the Association and/or ARC may, in addition to all other remedies 
contained herein, record a Certificate of Non-Compliance against the Lot stating that the 
improvements on the Lot fail to meet the requirements of this Declaration and that the Lot is 
subject to further enforcement remedies. 

19.17 Certificate of Compliance. If requested by an Owner, prior to the occupancy of any 
improvement constructed or erected on any Lot by other than Declarant, or its designees, the 
Owner shall obtain a Certificate of Compliance from the ARC, certifying that the Owner, as 
applicable, has complied with the requirements set forth herein. The ARC may, from time to time, 
delegate to a member or members of the ARC the responsibility for issuing the Certificate of 
Compliance. The issuance of a Certificate of Compliance does not abrogate the ARC's rights set 
forth in this Section 19. The issuance of a Certificate of Compliance by the ARC with respect to 
any improvements shall not be deemed a representation that such improvements comply with any 
or all applicable health, safety or building codes applicable to such improvements or representation 
regarding the structural integrity, workmanship, materials, design, systems, safety or any other 
aspect or matter with respect to such improvements. 

19.18 Exemption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, or in the 
Architectural Guidelines, any improvements of any nature made or to be made by Declarant or 
CDD, including without limitation, improvements made or to be made to the Common Areas, CDD 
Facilities or any Lot, shall not be subject to the review of the ARC, the Association, or the 
provisions of this Declaration or the Architectural Guidelines, but shall be in compliance with 
Approved Plans as provided in Section 28.8 below. 

19.19 Exculpation. Declarant, Association, the directors or officers of the Association, 
the ARC, the members of the ARC, or any person acting on behalf of any of them, shall not be 
liable for any cost or damages incurred by any Owner or any other party whatsoever, due to any 
mistakes in judgment, negligence, or any action of Declarant, Association, ARC or their members, 
officers, or directors, in connection with the approval or disapproval of plans and specifications or 
the issuance of a Certificate of Non-Compliance or a Certificate of Compliance with respect to 
such Owner's Lot or any improvements constructed thereon. Each Owner agrees, individually and 
on behalf of its heirs, successors and assigns by acquiring title to a Lot, that it shall not bring any 
action or suit against Declarant, Association or their respective directors or officers, the ARC or 
the members of the ARC, or their respective agents, in order to recover any damages caused by 
the actions of Declarant, Association, or ARC or their respective members, officers, or directors in 
connection with the provisions of this Section. Association does hereby indemnify, defend and 
hold Declarant, and the ARC, and each of their members, officers, and directors harmless from all 
costs, expenses, and liabilities, including attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees at all levels, 
including appeals, of all nature resulting by virtue of the acts of the Owners, the Association, ARC 
or their members, officers and directors. Declarant, Association, its directors or officers, the ARC 
or its members, or any person acting on behalf of any of them, shall not be responsible for any 
defects in any plans or specifications or the failure of same to comply with applicable laws or code 
nor for any defects in any improvements constructed pursuant thereto. Each party submitting plans 
and specifications for approval shall be solely responsible for the sufficiency thereof and for the 
quality of construction performed pursuant thereto. 
 
20. Enforcement.
20.1 Right to Cure. Should any Owner do any of the following: 

20.1.1 Fail to perform its responsibilities as set forth herein or in this Declaration 
or otherwise breach the provisions of this Declaration including, without limitation, any 
provision herein or therein benefiting SWFWMD; 

20.1.2 Cause any damage to any improvement or Common Areas; 

20.1.3 Impede Declarant or Association from exercising its rights or performing 
its responsibilities hereunder; or

Common Areas; or 

20.1.5 Impede Declarant from proceeding with or completing the development of 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY, as the case may be; 
Then Declarant and/or Association, where applicable, after reasonable prior written notice, 
shall have the right, through its agents and employees, to cure the breach, including, but not limited 
to, the entering upon the Lot and causing the default to be remedied and/or the required repairs or 
maintenance to be performed, or as the case may be, remove unauthorized improvements or 
modifications. The cost thereof, plus reasonable overhead costs and attorneys' fees and 
paraprofessional fees at all levels including appeals, collections and bankruptcy, incurred shall be 
assessed against the Owner, as applicable, as an Individual Assessment. 

20.2 Non-Monetary Defaults. In the event of a violation by any Owner, other than the 
nonpayment of any Assessment or other monies, of any of the provisions of this Declaration, 
Declarant or Association shall notify the Owner of the violation, by written notice. If such 
violation is not cured as soon as practicable and in any event within seven (7) days after such 
written notice, the party entitled to enforce same may, at its option: 

20.2.1 Commence an action to enforce the performance on the part of the Owner, 
as applicable, or to enjoin the violation or breach or for equitable relief as may be necessary 
under the circumstances, including injunctive relief: and/or 

20.2.2 Commence an action to recover damages: and/or 

20.2.3 Take any and all action reasonably necessary to correct the violation or 
breach. 

All expenses incurred in connection with the violation or breach, or the commencement of 
any action against any Owner, including reasonable attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees at all 
levels including appeals, collections and bankruptcy shall be assessed against the Owner, as 
applicable, as an Individual Assessment, and shall be immediately due and payable without further 
notice. 

20.3 No Waiver. The failure to enforce any right, provision, covenant or condition in 
this Declaration, shall not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce such right, provision, covenant 
or condition in the future. 

20.4 Rights Cumulative. All rights, remedies, and privileges granted to Declarant, 
Association and/or the ARC pursuant to any terms, provisions, covenants or conditions of this 
Declaration, or Architectural Guidelines, shall be deemed to be cumulative, and the exercise of 
any one or more shall neither be deemed to constitute an election of remedies, nor shall it preclude 
any of them from pursuing such additional remedies, rights or privileges as may be granted or as 
it might have by law. 

20.5 Enforcement B or Against Other Persons. In addition to the foregoing, this 
Declaration or Architectural Guidelines may be enforced by Declarant and/or, where applicable, 
the CDD, Owners, and/or the Association by any procedure at law or in equity against any person 
violating or attempting to violate any provision herein, to restrain such violation, to require 
compliance with the provisions contained herein, to recover damages, or to enforce any lien created 
herein. The expense of any litigation to enforce this Declaration or Architectural Guidelines shall 
be borne by the person against whom enforcement is sought, provided such proceeding results in 
a finding that such person was in violation of this Declaration or the Architectural Guidelines. 
SWFWMD shall have the right to enforce, by a proceeding at law or in equity, the provisions 
contained in the Declaration which relate to the maintenance, operation and repair of SWMS. 

20.6 Fines and Suspensions. Association may suspend, for reasonable periods of time, 
the rights of an Owner or an Owner's tenants, guests and invitees, or both, to use the Common 
Areas and may levy reasonable fines, not to exceed the maximum amounts permitted by Section 
720.305(2), Florida Statutes, against an Owner, tenant, guest or invitee, for failure to comply with 
any provision of this Declaration including, without limitation, those provisions benefiting 
SWFWMD and the Rules and Regulations and Architectural Guidelines. 

20.6.1 A fine may be levied on the basis of each day of a continuing violation, with 
a single notice and opportunity for hearing. Fines in the aggregate are not capped to any 
amount. 

20.6.2 A fine or suspension may not be imposed without notice of at least fourteen 
(14) days to the person sought to be fined or suspended and an opportunity for a hearing 
before a committee of at least three (3) persons (the "Compliance Committee") appointed 
by the Board who are not officers, directors or employees of the Association, or the spouse, 
parent, child, brother, sister of an officer, director or employee. If the Compliance 
Committee does not by a majority vote approve a fine or suspension the same may not be 
imposed. The written notice of violation shall be in writing to the Owner, tenant, guest or 
invitee and detail the infraction or infractions. Included in the notice shall be the date and 
time of the hearing of the Compliance Committee. If the Association imposes a fine or 
suspension, the Association must provide written notice of such suspension by mail or hand 
delivery to the Owner or Lessee. The notice and hearing requirements under this Section 

20.6.2 do not apply to suspensions imposed due to an Owner's failure to pay monetary 
obligations due to the Association; however, any such suspension must be approved at a 
properly noticed meeting of the Association's Board of Directors. 

20.6.3 The non-compliance shall be presented to the Compliance Committee 
acting as a tribunal, after which the Compliance Committee shall hear reasons why a fine 
or suspension should not be imposed. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with 
the procedures adopted by the Compliance Committee from time to time. A written 
decision of the Compliance Committee shall be submitted to the Owner, tenant, guest or 
invitee, as applicable, by not later than twenty-one (21) days after the meeting of the 
Compliance Committee. The Owner, tenant, guest or invitee shall have a right to be 
represented by counsel and to cross-examine witnesses. 

20.6.4 The Compliance Committee may impose a fine against the Owner in the 
amount of One Hundred and no/ 100 Dollars ($100.00) (or any greater amount permitted 
by law from time to time) for each violation. Each day of noncompliance shall be treated 
as a separate violation and there is no cap on the aggregate amount the Compliance 
Committee may fine an Owner, tenant, guest or invitee. Fines shall be paid not later than 
five (5) days after notice of the imposition of the fine. All monies received from fines shall 
be allocated as directed by the Board of Directors. Any fine in excess of One Thousand 
Dollars ($ 1,000.00) shall constitute a lien against the applicable Lot, and a fine shall further 
be lienable to the extent otherwise permitted under Florida law.
 
20.6.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compliance Committee may not 
suspend the right of any Owner, Lessee, Immediate Family Member, guest or invitee to use 
those portions of the Common Areas used to provide access or utility services to any Lot 
or Home or impose a suspension which impairs the right of any Owner, Lessee or 
Immediate Family Member to have vehicular and pedestrian ingress to and egress from 
their Lot or Home, including, but not limited to, the right to park vehicles as permitted in 
this Declaration. 
 
21. Additional Rights of Declarant.

21.1 Sales and Administrative Offices. Declarant shall have the perpetual right to take 
such action reasonably necessary to transact any business necessary to consummate the 
development of DEL WEBB BEXLEY and sales and re-sales of Lots, Homes and/01' other 
properties owned by Declarant or others outside of DEL WEBB BEXLEY. This right shall include, 
but not be limited to, the right to maintain models, sales offices and parking associated therewith, 
have signs on any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY, including Common Areas and CDD Facilities, 
as applicable, employees in the models and offices without the payment of rent or any other fee, 
maintain offices in models and use of the Common Areas and CDD Facilities, as applicable, to 
show Lots or Homes. The sales office and signs and all items pertaining to development and sales 
remain the property of Declarant. Declarant shall have all of the foregoing rights without charge 
or expense. The rights reserved hereunder shall extend beyond the Turnover Date. 

21.2 Modification. The development and marketing of DEL WEBB BEXLEY will 
continue as deemed appropriate in Declarant's sole discretion, and nothing in this Declaration or 
Architectural Guidelines, or otherwise, shall be construed to limit or restrict such development and 
marketing. It may be necessary or convenient for the development of DEL WEBB BEXLEY to, 
as an example and not a limitation, amend the Master Plan, modify the boundary lines of the 
Common Areas, grant easements, dedications, agreements, licenses, restrictions, reservations, 
covenants, rights-of-way, and to take such other actions which Declarant, or its agents, affiliates, 
or assignees may deem necessary or appropriate. Association and Owners shall, at the request of 
Declarant, execute and deliver any and all documents and instruments which Declarant deems 
necessary or convenient, in its sole and absolute discretion, to accomplish the same. 

21.3 Promotional Events. Prior to the Community Completion Date, Declarant shall 
have the right, at any time, to hold marketing, special and/or promotional events within DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY and/or on the Common Areas without any charge for use. Declarant, its agents, 
affiliates, or assignees shall have the right to market DEL WEBB BEXLEY in advertisements and 
other media by making reference to DEL WEBB BEXLEY, including, but not limited to, pictures 
or drawings of DEL WEBB BEXLEY, Common Areas, Parcels and Homes constructed in DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY. All logos, trademarks, and designs used in connection with DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY are the property of Declarant, and Association shall have no right to use the same after 
the Community Completion Date except with the express written permission of Declarant. 

21.4 Use by Prospective Purchasers. Prior to the Community Completion Date, 
Declarant shall have the right, without charge, to use the Common Areas, including the 
Recreational Facilities, for the purpose of entertaining prospective purchasers of Lots, Homes, or 
other properties owned by Declarant outside of DEL WEBB BEXLEY. 

21.5 Franchises. Declarant may grant franchises or concessions to commercial concerns 
on all or part of the Common Areas and shall be entitled to all income derived therefrom. 

21.6 Management. The Declarant may contract with a third party ("Manager") for 
management of the Association and the Common Areas. 

21.7 Easements. Until the Community Completion Date, Declarant reserves the right to 
grant, in its sole discretion, easements, permits and/or licenses for ingress and egress, drainage, 
utilities, maintenance, Telecommunications Services and other purposes over, under, upon and 
across DEL WEBB BEXLEY so long as any said easements do not materially and adversely 
interfere with the intended use of Homes previously conveyed to Owners. By way of example, 
and not of limitation, Declarant may be required to take certain action, or make additions or 
modifications to the Common Areas in connection with an environmental program. All easements 
necessary for such purposes are reserved in favor of Declarant, in perpetuity, for such purposes. 
Without limiting the foregoing, Declarant may relocate any easement affecting a Lot, or grant new 
easements over a Lot, after conveyance to an Owner, without the joinder or consent of such Owner, 
as applicable, so long as the grant of easement or relocation of easement does not materially and 
adversely affect the Owner's use of the Lot. As an illustration, Declarant may grant an easement 
for telecommunications systems, irrigation, drainage lines or electrical lines over any portion of a 
Lot so long as such easement is outside the footprint of the foundation of any residential 
improvement constructed on such Lot. Declarant shall have the sole right to any fees of any nature 
associated therewith, including, but not limited to, license or similar fees on account thereof. The 
Association and Owners will, without charge, if requested by Declarant: (i) join in the creation of 
such easements, etc. and cooperate in the operation thereof; and (ii) collect and remit fees 
associated therewith, if any, to the appropriate party. The Association will not grant any easements, 
permits or licenses to any other entity providing the same services as those granted by Declarant, 
nor will it grant any such easement, permit or license prior to the Community Completion Date 
without the prior written consent of Declarant which may be granted or denied in Declarant's 
discretion. 

21.8 Right to Enforce. Declarant has the right, but not the obligation, to enforce the 
provisions of this Declaration and the Architectural Guidelines and to recover all costs relating 
thereto, including attorneys' fees and paraprofessional fees and cost at all levels of proceeding, 
including before trial, in mediation, arbitration and other alternative dispute, resolution 
proceedings, at all trial levels and appeals, collections and bankruptcy. Such right shall include 
the right to perform the obligations of the Association and to recover all costs incurred in doing 
so. 

21.9 Additional Development. Subject to Section 28 below, if Declarant withdraws 
portions of DEL WEBB BEXLEY from the operation of this Declaration, then Declarant may, but 
is not required to, subject to governmental approvals, create other forms of residential property 
ownership or other improvements of any nature on the property not subjected to or withdrawn 
from the operation of this Declaration. Declarant shall not be liable or responsible to any person 
or entity on account of its decision to do so or to provide, or fail to provide, the amenities and/or 
facilities which were originally planned to be included in such areas. If so designated by Declarant, 
owners or tenants of such other forms of housing or improvements upon their creation may share 
in the use of all or some of the Common Areas and other facilities and/or roadways that remain 
subject to this Declaration. The expense of the operation of such facilities shall be allocated to the 
various users thereof, if at all, as determined by Declarant. 

21.10 Representations. Declarant makes no representations concerning development 
both within and outside the boundaries of DEL WEBB BEXLEY including, but not limited to, the 
number, design, boundaries, configuration and arrangements, prices of all Parcels or Homes and 
buildings in all other proposed forms of ownership and/or other improvements on DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY or adjacent to or near DEL WEBB BEXLEY, including, but not limited to, the size, 
location, configuration, elevations, design, building materials, height, view, airspace, number of 
homes, number of buildings, location of easements, parking and landscaped areas, services and 
amenities offered regarding the Common Areas and Recreational Facilities. 

21.11 Access/Entrance/Exit Gates Open During Day time Hours. Until the Community 
Completion Date, Declarant reserve a right and easement for access over and through the streets, 
private roadways, and sidewalks of DEL WEBB BEXLEY for ingress and egress for Declarant's 
employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, deliverymen, vendors, customers and invitees. At 
Declarant's sole option, until the Community Completion Date, all entrance or exit gates limiting 
access to DEL WEBB BEXLEY shall be open every day, including weekends and holidays, during 
hours to be established by Declarant from time to time (the "Declarant Operating Hours"). 

21.12 Non-Liability. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN 
THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS, THE DECLARANT, THE ASSOCIATION AND THE 
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR, OR IN ANY 
MANNER A GUARANTOR OR INSURER OF, THE HEALTH, SAFETY OR WELFARE OF 
ANY OWNER, OCCUPANT OR USER OF ANY PORTION OF DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES, GUESTS, 
LESSEES, LICENSEES, INVITEES, AGENTS, SERVANTS, CONTRACTORS, AND/OR 
SUBCONTRACTORS OR FOR ANY PROPERTY OF ANY SUCH WITHOUT LIMITING THE 
GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING: 

21.12.1 IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENT OF GOVERNING DOCUMENTS 
THAT THE VARIOUS PROVISIONS THEREOF WHICH ARE ENFORCEABLE BY 
ASSOCIATION AND WHICH GOVERN OR REGULATE THE USES OF DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN, AND ARE TO BE INTERPRETED AND 
ENFORCED, FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ENHANCING AND MAINTAINING 
THE ENJOYMENT OF DEL WEBB BEXLEY AND THE VALUE THEREOF: 

21.12.2 ASSOCIATION IS NOT EMPOWERED, AND HAS NOT BEEN 
CREATED, TO ACT AS AN AGENCY WHICH ENFORCES OR ENSURES THE 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND/OR THE 
COUNTY OR PREVENTS TORTIOUS ACTIVITIES; 

21.12.3 THE PROVISIONS OF GOVERNING DOCUMENTS SETTING 
FORTH THE USES OF ASSESSMENTS SHALL BE APPLIED ONLY AS 
LIMITATIONS ON THE USES OF ASSESSMENT FUNDS AND NOT AS CREATING 
A DUTY OF THE ASSOCIATION TO PROTECT OR FURTHER THE HEALTH, 
SAFETY, OR WELFARE OF ANY PERSON(S), EVEN IF ASSESSMENT FUNDS ARE 
CHOSEN TO BE USED FOR ANY SUCH REASON; AND 

21.12.4 EACH OWNER (BY VIRTUE Of ITS ACCEPTANCE OF TITLE 
TO A HOME) AND EACH OTHER PERSON HAVING AN INTEREST IN OR LIEN 
UPON, OR MAKING A USE OF, ANY PORTION OF DEL WEBB BEXLEY (BY 
VIRTUE OF ACCEPTING SUCH INTEREST OR LIEN OR MAKING SUCH USE) 
SHALL BE BOUND BY THIS SECTION AND SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE 
AUTOMATICALLY WAIVED ANY AND ALL RIGHTS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND 
CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST ASSOCIATION, DECLARANT AND INDEMNIFIED 
PARTIES ARISING FROM OR CONNECTED WITH ANY MATTER FOR WHICH 
THE LIABILITY OF THE ASSOCIATION, DECLARANT AND INDEMNIFIED 
PARTIES HAS BEEN DISCLAIMED IN THIS SECTION OR OTHERWISE. 

21.13 Resolution of Disputes. BY ACCEPTANCE OF A DEED, EACH OWNER 
AGREES THAT THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS ARE VERY COMPLEX; THEREFORE, 
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY 
ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM COUNTERCLAIM, OR CROSS CLAIM, WHETHER IN 
CONTRACT AND/OR IN TORT (REGARDLESS IF THE TORT ACTION IS PRESENTLY 
RECOGNIZED OR NOT), BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN 
ANY WAY RELATED TO GOVERNING DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING ANY COURSE OF 
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, VERBAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT, VALIDATION 
PROTECTION, ENFORCEMENT ACTION OR OMISSION OF ANY PARTY SHOULD BE 
HEARD IN A COURT PROCEEDING BY A JUDGE AND NOT A JURY IN ORDER TO BEST 
SERVE JUSTICE. DECLARANT HEREBY SUGGESTS THAT EACH OWNER 
UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF ACCEPTING A DEED TO A HOME. 

21.14 Venue. EACH OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES REGARDLESS OF WHERE SUCH 
OWNER (i) EXECUTED A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, (ii) RESIDES, (iii) 
OBTAINS FINANCING OR (iv) CLOSED ON A HOME, EACH HOME IS LOCATED IN 
PASCO COUNTY, FLORIDA. ACCORDINGLY, AN IRREBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION 
EXISTS THAT THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR THE RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE 
LIES IN PASCO COUNTY, FLORIDA. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, EACH OWNER 
AND DECLARANT AGREES THAT THE VENUE FOR RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE 
LIES IN PASCO COUNTY, FLORIDA. 

21.15 Reliance. BEFORE ACCEPTING A DEED TO A HOME, EACH OWNER HAS 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETAIN AN ATTORNEY IN ORDER TO CONFIRM THE VALIDITY 
OF THIS DECLARATION. BY ACCEPTANCE OF A DEED TO A HOME, EACH OWNER 
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE OR SHE HAS SOUGHT AND RECEIVED SUCH AN OPINION 
OR HAS MADE AN AFFIRMATIVE DECISION NOT TO SEEK SUCH AN OPINION. 
DECLARANT IS RELYING ON EACH OWNER CONFIRMING IN ADVANCE OF 
ACQUIRING A HOME THAT THIS DECLARATION IS VALID, FAIR AND ENFORCEABLE, 
SUCH RELIANCE IS DETRIMENTAL TO DECLARANT AND ACCORDINGLY, AN 
ESTOPPEL AND WAIVER EXISTS PROHIBITING EACH OWNER FROM TAKING THE 
POSITION THAT ANY PROVISION OF THIS DECLARATION IS INVALID IN ANY 
RESPECT. AS A FURTHER MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR DECLARANT TO SUBJECT 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY TO THIS DECLARATION AND/OR SELL A LOT OR HOME TO SUCH 
OWNER, EACH OWNER, BY ACCEPTANCE OF A DEED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR LOT 
OR HOME, SHALL BE DEEMED TO RELEASE, WAIVE, DISCHARGE, COVENANT NOT 
TO SUE, ACQUIT, SATISFY AND FOREVER DISCHARGE DECLARANT AND THE 
DECLARANT INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, CLAIMS, 
COUNTERCLAIMS, DEFENSES, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, SUITS, 
CONTROVERSIES, AGREEMENTS, PROMISES AND DEMANDS WHATSOEVER IN LAW 
OR IN EQUITY WHICH AN OWNER MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE, OR WHICH ANY 
PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, SUCCESSOR, HEIR OR ASSIGN OF OWNER 
HEREAFTER CAN, SHALL OR MAY HAVE AGAINST DECLARANT AND THE 
DECLARANT INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, FOR, UPON OR BY REASON OF ANY MATTER, 
CAUSE OR THING WHATSOEVER RESPECTING THIS DECLARATION, OR THE 
EXHIBITS HERETO. THIS RELEASE AND WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE AS BROAD 
AND INCLUSIVE AS PERMITTED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

21.16 Duration of Rights. The rights of Declarant sets forth in this Declaration shall, 
unless specifically provided to the contrary herein, extend for a period of time ending upon the 
earlier of: (i) the Community Completion Date or (ii) a relinquishment by Declarant in an 
amendment to the Declaration recorded in the Public Records. 

21.17 Additional Covenants. The Declarant may record additional covenants, conditions, 
restrictions, and easements applicable to portions of DEL WEBB BEXLEY, and may form 
condominium associations, sub-associations, or cooperatives governing such property. Any such 
instrument shall be consistent with the provisions of Section 4, and no person or entity shall record 
any declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions, or declaration of condominium or similar 
instrument affecting any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY without Declarant's prior review and 
prior written consent. Evidence of Declarant's prior written consent shall be obtained in the form 
of a joinder executed by the Declarant. Any attempted recordation without such consent shall 
result in such instrument being void and of no force and effect unless subsequently approved by 
written consent signed by the Declarant and recorded in the Public Records. 

21.18 Right to Approve Sales Materials. Prior to the Community Completion Date, all 
sales, promotional, and advertising materials for any sale of property in DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
may be subject to the prior written approval of Declarant. Declarant shall deliver notice of 
Declarant's approval or disapproval of all such materials and documents within thirty (30) days of 
receipt of such materials and documents, and, if disapproved, set forth the specific changes 
requested. If Declarant fails to do so within such thirty (30) day period, Declarant shall be deemed 
to have waived any objections to such materials and documents and to have approved the 
foregoing. Upon disapproval, the foregoing procedure shall be repeated until approval is obtained 
or deemed to be obtained. 

21.19 Use Name of Bexley, DEL WEBB BEXLEY and Del Webb Marks. No person or 
entity shall use the name "DEL WEBB BEXLEY," its logo, or any derivative of such name or logo 
in any printed or promotional material without the Declarant's prior written approval. Until the 
Turnover Date, the Declarant shall have the sole right to approve the use of DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
name and logo, and such right shall automatically pass to the Association after the Turnover Date. 
However, Owners may use the name DEL WEBB BEXLEY in printed or promotional matter 
where such term is used solely to specify that particular property is located within DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY. Del Webb Corporation is an affiliate of Declarant. Any use by the Association of names, 
marks, or symbols of Del Webb Corporation or any of its affiliates (collectively "Del Webb 
Marks") shall inure to the benefit of Del Webb Corporation and shall be subject to Del Webb 
Corporation's periodic review for quality control. The Association shall enter into license 
agreements with Del Webb Corporation, terminable with or without cause and in a form specified 
by Del Webb Corporation in its sole discretion, with respect to permissive use of certain Del Webb 
Marks. The Association shall not use any Del Webb Mark without Del Webb Corporation's prior 
written consent.
 
The name "BEXLEY," along with all logos associated with such name, are the proprietary 
trade names and/or service marks of the Founder or its affiliates. No person or entity, including 
Declarant, shall use the name "Bexley," or any associated logo or depiction, for advertising or any 
other purpose in any promotional material, whether printed, audio, video, or otherwise, in any 
signage, on any Internet website, or in any logo or depictions, without the prior written consent of 
the Founder or the owner of such mark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Declaration, Founder, or the owner of such "Bexley" trade names and services marks, shall not be 
deemed to consent to the use of trade names and/or service marks, or in any way to waive its rights 
thereto, by failure to consent or withhold consent in writing within any time required by this 
Declaration for Founder's consent. The Founder, or the mark or trademark owner may condition 
the use of protected names or marks upon the signing of one or more license agreement(s), which 
are intended to protect the tradenames and service marks from unauthorized use by others. Such 
license agreement(s) shall be non-exclusive, non-transferable, and in form and substance 
acceptable to the owner of the mark. Subject to such licensing agreements, the Association may 
use the word "Bexley" in its name. Other use by the Association, any Owner or the Declarant, is 
subject to the restrictions imposed in this section or otherwise imposed by Founder. 

21.20 Density Transfers. If any party shall develop any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
so that the number of Lots contained in such portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY is less than the 
allowable number of Lots allocated by governmental authorities to that particular Parcel, the 
excess allowable Lots not used by the such party (with respect to that Parcel) shall inure to the 
benefit of Declarant. 

21.21 Equal Treatment. So long as Declarant owns any property described in Exhibit "1" 
or "5", neither the Association nor any other entity shall, without the prior written consent of 
Declarant, adopt any policy, rule, or procedure that: 
 
21.21.1 limits the access of Declarant, its successors, assigns and/or
affiliates or their personnel and/or guests, including visitors, to the Common Areas of the 
Association or to any property owned by any of them; 
 
21.21.2 limits or prevents Declarant, its successors, assigns and/or affiliates

Declarant, its successors, assigns and/or affiliates in DEL WEBB BEXLEY (including 
purchasers qualifying under Section 16.2) from becoming members of the Association or 
enjoying full use of its Common Areas subject to the membership provisions of this 
Declaration and the Bylaws; 
 
21.21.4 impacts the ability of Declarant, its successors, assigns and/or
affiliates, to carry out to completion its development plans and related construction 
activities for DEL WEBB BEXLEY, as such plans are expressed in the Master Plan, as 
such may be amended and updated from time to time. Policies, rules, or procedures 
affecting the provisions of existing easements established by Declarant and limiting the 
establishment by Declarant of easements necessary to complete DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
shall be expressly included in this provision. Easements that may be established by 
Declarant shall include but shall not be limited to easements for development, construction 
and landscaping activities, access, drainage and utilities; or

affiliates to develop and conduct customer service programs and activities with respect to 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY in a customary and reasonable manner.
 
The Association shall not exercise its authority over the Common Areas (including, but not 
limited to, any gated entrances and other means of access to DEL WEBB BEXLEY or the 
Additional Property) in a manner that interferes with the rights of Declarant set forth in this 

Declaration or to impede access to any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY or the Additional Property 
over the streets and other Common Areas within DEL WEBB BEXLEY. The Association shall not 
condone, encourage it members or participate in public assembly for the purpose of interfering 
with Declarant's business within DEL WEBB BEXLEY or engage in any activity that presents a 
public health or safety risk.
 
21.22 Vacation Getaways. Declarant may, in its discretion, construct residential 
improvements and contract with third party providers for temporary occupancy in or adjacent to 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY and designate such improvements as within Declarants vacation program 
(the "Vacation Getaways"). Such Vacation Getaway units located outside of DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY shall not be Lots, and their owners shall not be Members of the Association. Vacation 
Getaway units shall have access to the Common Area and Recreational Facilities, including the 
Community Amenity, in consideration of the payment of reasonable use fees as provided by an 
arrangement negotiated between Declarant and Association prior to the commencement of such 
program.

Owners of Vacation Getaway Homes located within DEL WEBB BEXLEY shall be 
Members of the Association. Declarant may transfer or lease Vacation Getaway Homes and make 
Vacation Getaway Homes available for use by guests. Occupants of the Vacation Getaway Homes 
and units, whether located within or outside of DEL WEBB BEXLEY, shall have a non-exclusive 
easement for use, access and enjoyment in and to the Common Area, including but not limited to 
any Recreational Facilities and the Community Amenity. The Board shall assign Activity Cards 
or use privilege cards to Declarant on behalf of all owners of Vacation Getaway Homes located in 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY or Vacation Getaway units located outside DEL WEBB BEXLEY for the 
purpose of exercising such easement. Vacation Getaway Homes shall remain Vacation Getaway 
Homes until Declarant otherwise provides in written notice to the owner of such Vacation Getaway 
Home and to the Association. 

22. Refund of Taxes and Other Charges. Unless otherwise provided herein, Association agrees 
that any taxes, fees or other charges paid by Declarant to any governmental authority, utility 
company or any other entity which at a later date are refunded in whole or in part, shall be returned 
to Declarant in the event such refund is received by the Association. 

23. Assignment of Powers. Subject to Founder's prior written consent, all or any part of the 
rights, exemptions and powers and reservations of Declarant, as the case may be, herein contained 
may be conveyed or assigned in whole or part to other persons or entities by an instrument in 
writing duly executed, acknowledged and recorded in the Public Records. 

24. General Provisions. 

24.1 Authority of Board. Except when a vote of the membership of the Association is 
specifically required, all decisions, duties, and obligations of the Association hereunder may be 
made by the Board. The Association and Owners shall be bound thereby. 
 

24.2 Severability. Invalidation of any of the provisions of this Declaration by judgment
or court order shall in no way affect any other provision, and the remainder of this Declaration 
shall remain in full force and effect. 

24.3 Execution of Documents. Declarant's plan of development for the Property 
including, without limitation, the creation of one (l) or more special taxing districts may 
necessitate from time to time the execution of certain documents as required by governmental 
agencies. To the extent that said documents require the joinder of Owners, Declarant, by its duly 
authorized officers, may, as the agent or the attorney-in-fact for the Owners, execute, acknowledge 
and deliver such documents (including, without limitation, any consents or other documents 
required by any governmental agencies in connection with the creation of any special taxing 
district); and the Owners, by virtue of their acceptance of deeds, irrevocably nominate, constitute 
and appoint Declarant, through its duly authorized officers, as their proper and legal attorneys-in- 
fact, for such purpose. Said appointment is coupled with an interest and is therefore irrevocable. 
Any such documents executed pursuant to this Section may recite that it is made pursuant to this 
Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Owner agrees, by its acceptance of a deed to a Lot 
or any other portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY, to execute or otherwise join in any petition and/or 
other documents required in connection with the creation of any special taxing district relating to 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY or any portion(s) thereof. 

24.4 Affirmative Obligation of the Association. In the event that Association believes 
that Declarant has failed in any respect to meet Declarant's obligations under this Declaration or 
has failed to comply with any of Declarant's obligations under law or the Common Areas are 
defective in any respect, Association shall give written notice to Declarant detailing the alleged 
failure or defect. Association agrees that once Association has given written notice to Declarant 
pursuant to this Section, Association shall be obligated to permit Declarant and its agents to 
perform inspections of the Common Areas and to perform all tests and make all 
repairs/replacements deemed necessary by Declarant to respond to such notice at all reasonable 
times. Association agrees that any inspection, test and/or repair/replacement scheduled on a 
business day between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. shall be deemed scheduled at a reasonable time. The rights 
reserved in this Section include the right of Declarant to repair or address, in Declarant's sole 
option and expense, any aspect of the Common Areas deemed defective by Declarant during its 
inspections of the Common Areas. Association's failure to give the notice and/or otherwise 
comply with the provisions of this Section will damage Declarant. 

24.5 Notices. Any notice required to be sent to any person, firm, or entity under the 
provisions of this Declaration shall be deemed to have been properly sent when mailed, postpaid, 
to the last known address at the time of such mailing.

be deemed to refer to the Florida Statutes as they exist on the date this Declaration is recorded 
except to the extent provided otherwise as to any particular provision of the Florida Statutes. 

24.7 Construction Activities. ALL OWNERS, OCCUPANTS AND USERS OF DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY ARE HEREBY PLACED ON NOTICE THAT (l) DECLARANT, THE CDD 
AND/OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, 
LICENSEES AND OTHER DESIGNEES AND/OR (2) ANY OTHER PARTIES WILL BE, 
FROM TIME TO TIME, CONDUCTING CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES, EXCAVATION, 
CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES WITHIN OR IN PROXIMITY TO DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY, WHICH MAY CAUSE NOISE, DUST OR OTHER TEMPORARY DISTURBANCE. 
BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR DEED OR OTHER CONVEYANCE OR MORTGAGE, 
LEASEHOLD, LICENSE OR OTHER INTEREST, AND BY USING ANY PORTION OF DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY, EACH SUCH OWNER, OCCUPANT AND USER AUTOMATICALLY 
ACKNOWLEDGES, STIPULATES AND AGREES (i) THAT NONE OF THE AFORESAID 
ACTIVITIES SHALL BE DEEMED NUISANCES OR NOXIOUS OR OFFENSIVE 
ACTIVITIES, HEREUNDER OR AT LAW GENERALLY, (ii) NOT TO ENTER UPON, OR 
ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN OR OTHER PERSONS UNDER THEIR CONTROL OR 
DIRECTION TO ENTER UPON (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH ENTRY IS A 
TRESPASS OR OTHERWISE) ANY PROPERTY WITHIN OR IN PROXIMITY TO DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY WHERE SUCH ACTIVITY IS BEING CONDUCTED (EVEN IF NOT BEING 
ACTIVELY CONDUCTED AT THE TIME OF ENTRY, SUCH AS AT NIGHT OR OTHERWISE 
DURING NON-WORKING HOURS), (iii) DECLARANT AND THE OTHER AFORESAID 
RELATED PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES 
(COMPENSATORY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHERWISE), INJURIES OR 
DEATHS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE AFORESAID ACTIVITIES, EXCEPT 
RESULTING DIRECTLY FROM DECLARANT'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL 
MISCONDUCT, AND (iv) ANY PURCHASE OR USE OF ANY PORTION OF DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY HAS BEEN AND WILL BE MADE WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
FOREGOING. 

24.8 Title Documents. Each Owner by acceptance of a deed to a Lot acknowledges that 
such Lot is subject to certain land use and title documents recorded in the Public Records or issued 
by the County (collectively, the "Title Documents"). Declarant's plan of development for DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY may necessitate from time to time the further amendment, modification and/or 
termination of the Title Documents. DECLARANT RESERVES THE UNCONDITIONAL 
RIGHT TO SEEK AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS OF THE TITLE DOCUMENTS. 
It is possible that a governmental subdivision or agency may require the execution of one or more 
documents in connection with an amendment, modification, and/or termination of the Title 
Documents. To the extent that such documents require the joinder of Owners, Declarant, by any 
one of its duly authorized officers, may, as the agent and/or the attorney-in-fact for the Owners, 
execute, acknowledge and deliver any documents required by applicable governmental 
subdivision or agency; and the Owners, by virtue of their acceptance of deeds, irrevocably 
nominate, constitute and appoint Declarant, through any one of its duly authorized officers, as their 
proper and legal attorney-in-fact for such purpose. This appointment is coupled with an interest 
and is therefore irrevocable. Any such documents executed pursuant to this Section may recite 
that it is made pursuant to this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Owner agrees, by its 
acceptance of a deed to a Lot: (i) to execute or otherwise join in any documents required in 
connection with the amendment, modification, or termination of the Title Documents; and (ii) that

of the Governing Documents by any person, and no termination or amendment of this Declaration, 
will be effective to change the CDD's responsibilities for the SWMS, unless the amendment has 
been consented to in writing by SWFWMD. Any proposed amendment which would affect the 
SWMS or any conservation areas must be submitted to SWFWMD for a determination of whether 
the amendment necessitates a modification of the Permit. Any amendment affecting the SWMS

CDD fails to operate and maintain the SWMS in accordance with the requirements of SWFWMD,

Association, by and through the Board shall have the right to promulgate Rules and Regulations 
which regulate or restrict these activities or any other activities which, in the sole determination of 
the Board, attract wild creatures onto DEL WEBB BEXLEY. For purposes of illustration and not

but shall not be obligated to, maintain or support various activities within DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
which are intended to foster or promote safety or security. In no event shall the Association, the 
Declarant or Indemnified Parties in any way be considered insurers or guarantors of security within 

DEL WEBB BEXLEY, nor shall any of them be held liable for any loss or damage by reason of 
the lack of adequate security or safety measures or the ineffectiveness of any security or safety 
measures undertaken. No representation or warranty is made that any manned gatehouse, 
electronically operated entrance and exit gates, fire protection system, burglar alarm system or 
other security system installed or security measures undertaken on or about DEL WEBB BEXLEY 
cannot be compromised or circumvented, nor that any such systems or security measures will 
prevent loss or provide the detection or protection for which they may be designed or intended. 
Each Owner therefore acknowledges, understands and agrees that the Declarant, the Association, 
and the Indemnified Parties are not insurers or guarantors of safety or security and that each person 
entering upon DEL WEBB BEXLEY assumes all risks of loss or damage to persons and property 
resulting from the acts of third parties. Furthermore, each Owner specifically acknowledges,

BEXLEY are only provided as traffic control devices and are not provided as a measure of safety 
or security. 

26.4 Traffic Enforcement. At the Association's option, the Association may enter into 
an agreement to provide for enforcement of traffic laws within DEL WEBB BEXLEY by the 
sheriff and all costs of such enforcement incurred by the sheriff shall be paid by the Association as 
an Operating Expense. 

26.5 Gatehouses. Gatehouses may be constructed within or adjacent to DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY in order to limit access and to provide more privacy for the Owners and Lessees. Each 
Owner and Lessee and their Immediate Family Members, guests and invitees, acknowledge that 
any such gatehouse may restrict or delay entry into, or access within DEL WEBB BEXLEY by 
police, fire department, ambulances and other emergency vehicles or personnel. Each Owner and 
Lessee and their Immediate Family Members, guests and invitees agree to assume the risk that any 
such gatehouse will restrict or delay entry into, or access within DEL WEBB BEXLEY by police, 
fire department, ambulances or other emergency vehicles or personnel. Neither the Declarant, the 
Association nor any of the Indemnified Parties shall be liable to any Owner or Lessee or their 
Immediate Family Members, guests or invitees for any claims or damages resulting directly or 
indirectly from the construction, existence, maintenance, operation, delays in operation, staffing 
or failure or delay in staffing of any such gatehouses. 
If any gatehouses are constructed within DEL WEBB BEXLEY, the Declarant makes no 
representations or warranties (i) that gatehouse staffing will be provided, (ii) if gatehouse staffing 
is provided, that it will be provided during any particular hours or be continued in the future, (iii) 
regarding training of gatehouse staff or (iv) operational policies and activities of the gatehouse 
staff. Nothing contained in this Declaration and nothing that may be represented to a purchaser 
by real estate brokers or salesmen representing the Declarant shall be deemed to create any 
covenants or restrictions, implied or express, with respect to the existence, operation or 
effectiveness of any gatehouses or gatehouse staff. 

26.6 Recreational Facilities and Services Open to the Public. Declarant, prior to 
Turnover, and thereafter the Association, has the right to make the Recreational Facilities available 
to Persons other than Owners or Lessees by issuing passes or Activity Cards to such Persons. The

for any Person using the Recreational Facilities who is not an Owner or Lessee. Any such Person 
entitled to use the Recreational Facilities is granted a non-exclusive license to use the Recreational 
Facilities subject to full compliance with all obligations imposed by the Governing Documents, 
including without limitation all Rules and Regulations. The granting of such rights shall not reduce 
or abate any Owner's obligation to pay Assessments authorized pursuant to the terms of the 
Governing Documents, or give any Owner the right to avoid any of the provisions of the Governing 
Documents. 

26.7 Activity Cards. At the discretion of the Board, Activity Cards may be issued to 
allow Owners and Lessees access to the Recreational Facilities. 

26.7. I Issuance by the Board. One (1) Activity Card shall be allocated to each 
Qualified Occupant of a Home, up to a maximum of two (2) Activity Cards per Home. The 
Board shall determine entitlement to Activity Cards on an annual basis. Activity Cards shall 
be renewed annually, provided, the Home continues to be occupied by a Qualified 
Occupant and all applicable Assessments and other charges pertaining to the Lot and Home 
have been paid. The Board may establish policies, limits and charges with regard to the 
issuance of additional, renewal or replacement Activity Cards and guest privilege cards. 

26.7.2 Assignment of Rights. The right to an Activity Card is based upon 
Occupancy of a Home. Any Owner who leases or otherwise transfers Occupancy of his 
or her Home shall be deemed to have assigned his or her rights to an Activity Card to the 
Lessee or Occupant of such Lot. The Lessee or Occupant of the Home shall be entitled to 
an Activity Card only if the Home continues to be occupied by a Qualified Occupant and 
in no event shall an Activity Card be assigned to anyone under nineteen (19) years of age. 
Any Owner who leases or otherwise transfers Occupancy of his or her Home shall provide 
the Association with immediate written notice thereof and shall surrender to the 
Association his or her previously issued Activity Cards. Activity Cards shall be surrendered

shall be allocated one Activity Card per guest per stay in that Vacation Getaway (up to a

Getaway. Additional Activity Cards shall be issued to Declarant upon request with payment 
of the then current charge for additional Activity Cards. 

26.7.4 Issuance to Declarant. As long as Declarant owns any portion of DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY or has the right to annex property pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof, the 
Association shall provide Declarant, free of charge, with as many Activity Cards as 
Declarant, in its sole discretion, deems necessary for the purpose of marketing DEL WEBB 
BEXLEY or the Additional Property described in Exhibit "5". Declarant may transfer the 
Activity Cards to prospective purchasers of Lots or Homes subject to such terms and 
conditions as it, in its sole discretion, may determine. Activity Cards provided to Declarant 
shall entitle the bearer to use all Common Areas and Recreational Facilities, including the 
Community Amenity (subject to the availability and payment of admission fees or other 
use fees charged to Owners or Lessees holding Activity Cards). 

27. Conservation Easements. 

27.1 Establishment of Conservation Easements. The provisions of Section 704.06, 
Florida Statutes establish the right of the SWFWMD and/or the County (the "Easement Grantee") 
to accept easements for the preservation of the natural habitat (such easements shall be referred to 
herein as the "Conservation Easements"). The easement areas for certain recorded Conservation 
Easements in favor of the SWFWMD are set forth on the Plat, or may be set forth on plats or in 
recorded instruments affecting land within the Bexley Residential Community in or around DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY. There are no other Conservation Easements established by this Declaration; 
however, Declarant reserves unto itself and to the Association the right to grant such easements 
over and upon portions of the Common Area or Lots unto the Easement Grantee pursuant to the 
provisions of Section 704.06, Florida Statutes. Any Conservation Easements so granted shall be 
subject to the requirements of Section 704.06, Florida Statutes, and the following provisions. For

Easements. 

27.2 Purpose. The purpose of a Conservation Easement is to assure that the 
Conservation Easement Property will be retained forever in its existing natural condition and to

Conservation Easement to prevent the construction and operation of docks, piers, boardwalks, or 
other preemptive structures that would extend through the Conservation Easement Property onto

27.3.3.4 Activities conducted in accordance with a wildfire
mitigation plan developed with the Florida Forest Service that has been approved 
in writing by the SWFWMD are authorized. No later than thirty (30) days before 
commencing any activities to implement the approved wildfire mitigation plan, the 
owner of the Conservation Easement Property shall notify the SWFWMD in 
writing of its intent to commence such activities. All such activities may only be 
completed during the time period for which the SWFWMD approved the plan. 

27.3.4 excavating, dredging, or removing loam, peat, gravel, soil, rock, or other 
material substances in such a manner as to affect the surface; 

27.3.5 using the surface area of the Conservation Easement Property, except for

detrimental to the preservation of the structural integrity or physical appearance of sites or 
properties of historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural significance. 

27.4 Reserved Rights. The owner of record title to the Conservation Easement Property 
reserves unto itself, and its successors and assigns, all rights accruing from its ownership of the 
Conservation Easement Property, including, without limitation, the right to engage in or permit or 
invite others to engage in all uses of the Conservation Easement Property that are not expressly 
prohibited herein and are not inconsistent with the Permit (or any modifications thereto), and the 
Management Plan, and the purposes of the Conservation Easement. 

27.5 Rights of Easement Grantee. To accomplish the purposes stated herein, the owner 
of record title to the Conservation Easement Property shall, grant the following rights to the 
Easement Grantee and Declarant: 

27.5. I To enter upon the Conservation Easement Property at reasonable times with 
any necessary equipment or vehicles to inspect, determine compliance with the covenants 
and prohibitions contained in the Conservation Easement, and to enforce the rights therein 
granted in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with the use and quiet enjoyment 
of the Conservation Easement Property by the owner thereof at the time of such entry; and 

27.5.2 To proceed at law or in equity to enforce the provisions of the Conservation 
Easement and the covenants set forth therein, to prevent the occurrence of any of the 
prohibited activities set forth therein, and to require the restoration of such areas or features 
of the Conservation Easement Property that may be damaged by any activities or use that 
is inconsistent with the Conservation Easement. 

27.6 Easement Grantee's Discretion. The Easement Grantee may enforce the terms of 
the Conservation Easement at its discretion, but if the CDD, Association, Declarant, or any Owner, 
breaches any term of the Conservation Easement and the Easement Grantee does not exercise its 
rights under the Conservation Easement, the Easement Grantee's forbearance shall not be 
construed to be a waiver by the Easement Grantee of such term, or of any subsequent breach of 
the same, or any other term of the Conservation Easement, or of any of the Easement Grantee's 
rights under the Conservation Easement. No delay or omission by the Easement Grantee in the 
exercise of any right or remedy upon any breach by the CDD, Association, Declarant or any Owner 
shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver. The Easement Grantee shall not be 
obligated to Declarant, or to any other person or entity, to enforce the provisions of the 
Conservation Easement. 

27.7 Easement Grantee's Liability. The owner of the fee interest in the Conservation 
Easement Property shall retain all liability for any injury or damage to the person or property of 
third parties that may occur on the Conservation Easement Property. Neither Declarant, nor any 
Owner, nor any person or entity claiming by or through Declarant or any Owner, shall hold the 
Easement Grantee liable for any damage or injury to person or personal property that may occur 
on the Conservation Easement Property. 

27.8 Riparian Rights. The Conservation Easement shall convey to Easement Grantee 
the grantor's riparian rights of ingress and egress for boat docks, piers, boardwalks, and other 
preemptive structures and activities associated with the Conservation Easement Property except 
as necessary to construct, use, and maintain the structures and activities approved in the Permit (or 
any modification thereto) or Management Plan. 

27.9 Acts Beyond Declarant's CDD's or Association's Control. Nothing contained in 
the Conservation Easement shall be construed to entitle the Easement Grantee to bring any action 
against Declarant, the CDD or the Association for any injury to or change in the Conservation 
Easement Property resulting from natural causes beyond Declarant's, CDD's or the Association's 
control, including, without limitation, fire, flood, storm and earth movement, or from any 
necessary action taken by Declarant, CDD or the Association under emergency conditions to 
prevent, abate, or mitigate significant injury to the Conservation Easement Property or to persons 
resulting from such causes. 

27.10 Recordation. Declarant shall record any Conservation Easement in a timely fashion 
and Declarant and the Owners of any Lots encumbered by the Conservation Easement shall re- 
record it by separate instrument at any time the Easement Grantee may require to preserve its 
rights. The Owners of any Lots encumbered by the Conservation Easement shall pay all recording 
costs and taxes necessary to record the Conservation Easement. Declarant will hold the Easement 
Grantee harmless from any recording costs or taxes necessary to record the Conservation 
Easement. 

27.11 Successors. The covenants, terms, conditions, and restrictions of the Conservation 
Easement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective 
personal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns and shall continue as a servitude running 
in perpetuity with the Conservation Easement Property. 

27.12 Restrictive Covenants Affecting Conservation Easements. No Owner or other 
person shall cut, remove, destroy, or otherwise disturb any plant, shrub, tree, or other vegetation 
within any Conservation Easement Property, nor shall any person, including, but not limited to any 
Owner, Declarant, CDD and the Association, deposit dirt, fill, grass clippings, trash, rubbish, tree 
trimmings, building materials, or other waste within, or grade or alter such Conservation Easement 
Property without the prior written consent (as evidenced by any required permit or other official 
certification) of the CDD, Association, Declarant, the County, and the SWFWMD.

a member of the Board pursuant to this Declaration and the Florida Statutes.

Records Book 9654, Page 1561, of the Public Records (the "Founder Post Closing Agreement") 
setting forth certain agreements and granting certain easements with respect to the development of 
DEL WEBB BEXLEY and the Additional Property, which is currently owned by Founder and 
which Declarant has the obligation to purchase in one or more takedowns pursuant to the Declarant 
Purchase Contract. Such agreements and easements include the following:

Founder Post Closing Agreement, I)eclarant has granted to Founder, for the benefit of the 
Additional Property, a non-exclusive easement for ingress and egress (the "Additional

Additional Property Access Easement and Additional Property Utility Easement is to 
provide a means of providing access and extending utilities to the Additional Property. The 
Additional Property Access Easement will automatically terminate upon conveyance by 
deed, or dedication by plat, of the Additional Property Access and Utilities Easement Area 
to the County or a community development district, which provides equivalent rights 
enabling the Additional Property to be served by public access. The Additional Property 
Utility Easement shall automatically terminate upon the grant or dedication of public utility 
easement(s) contiguous to the Additional Property, which provide equivalent rights 
enabling the Additional Property to be served by public utilities. 
 
28.14.2 Drainage Easement. Pursuant to Paragraph 2(b) of the Founder Post
Closing Agreement, Declarant granted to Founder, for the benefit of the Additional 
Property, a non-exclusive drainage easement (the "Additional Property Drainage

Phase I Plat, the Additional Property Drainage Easement shall be over only those portions 
of the Phase I Property constituting drainage areas which serve to provide drainage to the 
Additional Property (together the "Additional Property Drainage Easement Areas"). 
The Additional Property Drainage Easement shall automatically terminate upon the grant 
or dedication of public drainage easement(s) contiguous to the Additional Property which 
provide equivalent rights enabling the Additional Property to be served by public drainage. 
 
28.14.3 Maintenance of Easement Areas. Paragraph 2(d) of the Founder 
Post Closing Agreement provides that Declarant will maintain the Additional Property 
Access and Utility Easement Area and Additional Property Drainage Easement Areas 
owned by it in good condition and repair in compliance with all Applicable Laws, as 
defined in the Founder Post Closing Agreement. The Additional Property Access and 
Utility Easement Area constitutes Common Area under this Declaration. Accordingly, 
Declarant hereby assigns to the Association, and the Association, by its joinder in this 
Declaration, hereby accepts, assumes and agrees to perform, all duties and obligations to 
maintain the Additional Property Access and Utility Easement Area in accordance with the 
Founder Post Closing Agreement. The Additional Property Drainage Easement Areas

28.14.4 Additional Terms and Non-Modification. The disclosures regarding 
the Founder Post Closing Agreement set forth in this Section 28.14 are provided for 
informational purposes and are not intended to provide a complete summary of all of the 
terms, covenants and conditions of the Founder Post Closing Agreement. Additional terms, 
conditions and covenants with respect to the Additional Property Access and Utility 
Easement and Additional Property Drainage Easement and additional covenants and 
agreements regarding the development of DEL WEBB BEXLEY and the Additional 
Property are more particularly set forth in the Founder Post Closing Agreement. Neither 
the disclosures regarding the Founder Post Closing Agreement set forth in this Section 

28.14 nor Founder's joinder in this Declaration shall serve to modify, negate, waive or in 
any other way alter the terms, covenants and conditions of the Founder Post Closing 
Agreement or the enforcement of any rights, obligations and remedies arising from or 
under the Founder Post Closing Agreement. 
 
28.14.5 Release of Lots Common Areas and CDD Tracts. Paragraph 14 of
the Founder Post Closing Agreement provides that, except as provided hereinbelow, the 
Founder Post Closing Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force 
and effect with respect to any portion of DEL WEBB BEXLEY transferred to the CDD, 
the Association (as the "Neighborhood Association" under the Founder Post Closing 
Agreement) or any Owner who acquires title to a Lot with a Home. Such Paragraph 14 
also provides that, notwithstanding the foregoing termination of the Founder Post Closing 
Agreement with respect to property transferred to the CDD, Association and any such 
Owner, the terms of Paragraph 2 of the Additional Property Agreement shall not terminate 
and shall remain in effect with respect to any Lot, Common Area or CDD Tract in DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY containing either the Additional Property Access and Utility Easement 
Area or the Additional Property Drainage Easement Areas. 

28.15 Conflicting Terms or Provisions. In the event of any conflict between the terms of 
this Section 28 and any other term or provisions of this Declaration, the terms of this Section 28 
shall govern. 
 
29. Bexley Community Development District. DEL WEBB BEXLEY is or will be within the
jurisdiction of the CDD and subject to CDD Assessments. Portions of DEL WEBB BEXLEY, may 
be owned by the CDD, including, but not limited to, open space areas, drainage systems, and the 
SWMS, the Conservation Easement Property, the utilities and/or wetland conservation areas. In 
the event that any portions of DEL WEBB BEXLEY are owned by the CDD, such facilities shall 
not be part of the Common Areas, but will be part of the infrastructure facilities owned by the CDD 
(the "CDD Facilities"). EACH PERSON BY ACCEPTANCE OF A DEED TO A LOT HEREBY 
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THE CDD FACILITIES ARE NOT COMMON AREA 
OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE ASSOCIATION AND FURTHER WAIVES ANY 
CLAIM OR RIGHT TO HAVE ANY PORTION OF THE CDD FACILITIES BE CONSIDERED 
AS COMMON AREA. 

29.1 Creation of the CDD. The CDD is an independent, multi-purpose, special district 
created pursuant to Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes. Lots, Homes and other portions of DEL 
WEBB BEXLEY are under the jurisdiction of the CDD. The CDD may be authorized to finance, 
fund, install, equip, extend, construct or reconstruct, without limitation, the following: water and 
sewer facilities, subdivision improvements, environmental mitigation, roadways, the SWMS, the 
Conservation Easement Property, utility lines, land acquisition, perimeter walls/fences, 
miscellaneous utilities for DEL WEBB BEXLEY and other infrastructure projects and services 
necessitated by the development of, and serving lands within, DEL WEBB BEXLEY (the "Public 
Infrastructure"). The estimated design, development, construction and acquisition costs for these 
CDD Facilities may be funded by the CDD in one or more series of governmental bond financings 
utilizing special assessment bonds. The CDD may issue both long term debt and short term debt 
to finance the Public Infrastructure. The principal and interest on the special assessments bonds 
may be repaid through non ad valorem special assessments (the "CDD Debt Service 
Assessments") levied on all benefiting properties in the CDD, which property has been found to 
be specially benefited by such Public Infrastructure. In addition to the bonds issued to fund the 
Public Infrastructure costs, the CDD may also impose non ad valorem special assessment to fund 
the operations of the CDD and the maintenance and repair of its Public Infrastructure and services 
(the "CDD Assessments"). 

29.2 CDD Assessments. The CDD Assessments, including the CDD Debt Service 
Assessments and CDD O&M Assessments, will not be taxes but, under Florida law, constitute a 
lien co-equal with the lien of state, County, municipal, and school board taxes and may be collected 
on the ad valorem tax bill sent each year by the Tax Collector of Pasco County and disbursed to 
the CDD. The homestead exemption is not applicable to the CDD Assessments. Because a tax bill 
cannot be paid in part, failure to pay the CDD Assessments or any other portion of the tax bill will 
result in the sale of tax certificates and could ultimately result in the loss of title to the property of 
the delinquent taxpayer through the issuance of a tax deed. Any future CDD Assessments and/or 
other charges due with respect to the CDD Facilities are direct obligations of Owner and are 
secured by a lien against Owner's Lot and Home. Failure to pay such sums may result in loss of 
an Owner's Lot and Home. 

29.3 Common Areas and Facilities Part of CDD. Portions of the Common Areas may 
become part of the CDD. In such event, Common Areas will become part of the CDD Facilities, 
will be part of the CDD and the CDD shall govern the use and maintenance of the CDD Facilities. 
Some of the provisions of this Declaration will not apply to such CDD Facilities, as the CDD 
Facilities will no longer be Common Areas once conveyed to the CDD. Any conveyance of 
Common Areas to the CDD shall in no way invalidate this Declaration. Declarant may decide, in 
its sole and absolute discretion, to convey additional portions of the Common Areas to the CDD 
or the Association. If conveyed to the CDD, such portions of the Common Areas shall thereafter 
be part of the CDD Facilities. The CDD may promulgate membership rules, regulations and/or 
covenants that may outline use restrictions for the CDD Facilities, including the Community 
Amenity, or the Association's responsibility to maintain the CDD Facilities, if any. Among other 
factors, the establishment of the CDD and the inclusion of CDD Facilities in the CDD obligates 
each Owner to become responsible for the payment of CDD Debt Service Assessments and CDD 
O&M Assessments for the construction and operation of the CDD Facilities as set forth in this 
Section. 

29.4 Facilities Owned by CDD. The CDD Facilities may be owned and operated by the 
CDD or owned by the CDD and maintained by the Association. The CDD Facilities may be owned 
by a governmental entity other than the CDD. The CDD Facilities shall be used and enjoyed by 
the Owners on a non-exclusive basis, in common with such other persons, entities, and 
corporations that may be entitled to use the CDD Facilities under the CDD Documents, applicable 
laws and regulations, or otherwise. 

29.5 CDD Facilities Maintenance. The CDD rnay contract with the Association for the 
maintenance, repair, and replacement, management and operation of the CDD Facilities, subject 
to any written agreement accepted by the Association. 

29.6 Additional Disclosure. THE BEXLEY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
DISTRICT MAY IMPOSE AND LEVY TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS, OR BOTH TAXES AND 
ASSESSMENTS, ON THIS PROPERTY. THESE TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS PAY THE 
CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION, AND MAINTENANCE COSTS OF CERTAIN PUBLIC 
FACILITIES AND SERVICES OF THE DISTRICT AND ARE SET ANNUALLY BY THE 
GOVERNING BOARD OF THE DISTRICT. THESE TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS ARE IN 
ADDITION TO COUNTY AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL TAXES AND 
ASSESSMENTS AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS PROVIDED FOR BY 
LAW.

Tampa, FL 33578 

OTHER PERMITTEES:  N/A

ABSTRACT: This permit modification authorizes construction of single-family residential lots, roadways and associated 
infrastructure for Parcel 5, Phase 1 of the Bexley Ranch development. This permit modifies the stormwater management 
systems previously approved under Permit Nos. 43013740.015 and 43013740.016, entitled Sunlake Boulevard Extension 
North of Tower Road and Bexley North Parcel 5 Mass Grading Plan, respectively. The perpetual operation, maintenance 
and reinspection requirements for ponds 120 and 133 (Permit No. 43013740.015) and 133A, B, D, E and F (Permit No. 
43013740.016) will be tracked under this permit modification No. 43013740.017, upon transfer of this permit to the operation 
phase. The stormwater management system has been designed to limit the peak post-development 25-year, 24-hour 
discharge rate to the peak pre-development 25-year, 24-hour discharge rate. The Engineer-of-Record has provided 
calculations that demonstrate the proposed construction will not cause any adverse impacts offsite or onsite for the 
25-year, 24-hour and 100-yeart 24-hour storm events. The site is located 2.5 miles north of State Road 54 approximately 3 
miles east of the Suncoast Parkway, in Pasco County. Information regarding the stormwater management system, 
1 CO-year floodplain, wetlands and/or surface waters is stated below and on the permitted construction drawings for the 
proposed project.
